# Notebook Database File

#--------------------------------------------------
# #---

page #--- {The "<m>#---</m>" [directive] draws a horizontal line across the page.  
For example,

#---

The line above was drawn by a "<m>#---</m>" directive.  The "#" character
must be in the first column of text.

Any text that follows "<m>#---</m>" on the same line is ignored.} 1114045789


#--------------------------------------------------
# #data

page #data {The "<m>#data</m>" [directive] indicates that the following lines contain 
some kind of textual data.  The data continues until the matching
"<m>[#undata]</m>" directive is encountered, or until the end of the page.
By using "<m>#data</m>" and "<m>[#undata]</m>" together you can include
multiple blocks of data of various kinds on a single page, interspersed 
with normal [Notebook Markup].

The syntax of the <m>#data</m> directive is as follows:

<m>#data ?<i>type</i>? ?<i>name</i>? ?<i>args...</i>?</m>

As always, the "#" must be in the first column of the line. 

For the moment, text bracketed by <m>#data</m> and <m>#undata</m> is 
displayed preformatted.  In the future, Notebook might have the capacity
to format and display specific data types--e.g., other Wiki notations,
diagrams, and so forth--in appropriate ways.  At that time, different
supported types can adjust themselves according to their <i>args</i>.  

At present, the only specific <i>type</i> recognized and specially handled by
Notebook is "<m>html</m>".  When [exporting a page to HTML], any text
bracketed by "<m>#data html</m>" and "<m>#undata</m>" will be copied to
the output unchanged--for example, "<" and ">" will not be translated to
"&amp;lt;" and "&amp;gt;".} 1112494473


#--------------------------------------------------
# #meta

page #meta {The "<m>#meta</m>" [directive] is used to specify page-specific settings
for page formatting and export options.  The syntax is as follows:

: <m>#meta <i>name</i> <i>value</i></m>

For example, the follow directive indicates that the background color for
normal text should be blue -- or at least it would if Notebook paid any
attention to it.

 #meta textbg blue

The "<m>#meta</m>" directive is still experimental; and for now is
probably best ignored.} 1114045863


#--------------------------------------------------
# #pre

page #pre {The "<m>#pre</m>" [directive] tells Notebook to display the following
lines as [preformatted text], regardless of what it looks 
like--but remember that [embedded macro]s are still expanded.  The block of
preformatted text continues until the next "<m>#unpre</m>" directive, or
the end of the page.  

The "#" in "<m>#pre</m>" and "<m>#unpre</m>" must
be in the first column of the line. 

Note that the the "<m>#pre</m>" and "<m>#unpre</m>" directives themselves
are never displayed.} 1111979546


#--------------------------------------------------
# #rem

page #rem {The "<m>#rem</m>" directive is used to add undisplayed comments (remarks)
to Notebook pages.  All text on the "<m>#rem</m>" line is ignored.  For example,

#pre
#rem These are comments; I'll see them when I'm editing,
#rem but not when I'm browsing.
#unpre

An excellent use for the <m>#rem</m> directive is to add search keywords
to pages.} 1114958769


#--------------------------------------------------
# #Tcl

page #Tcl {The "<m>#Tcl</m>" [directive] indicates that the following lines contain 
program code in [the Tcl language].  The Tcl code continues until the next
"<m>[#unTcl]</m>" directive is encountered, or until the end of the page.
By using "<m>#Tcl</m>" and "<m>[#unTcl]</m>" together you can include
multiple blocks of Tcl code on a single page, interspersed with normal
[Notebook Markup].

Notebook's on-line help is stored in Notebook format; see its
[User Code] page for an example of how to use intermingled <m>#Tcl</m>
blocks and [Notebook Markup] to good effect.

Tcl code is displayed preformatted, and may be executed and loaded into
memory on demand; see [Defining new commands].  Consequently,
"<m>#Tcl</m>" and "<m>[#unTcl]</m>" are most often used on [User Code Page]s.

The "<m>#Tcl</m>" and "<m>[#unTcl]</m>" directive lines are also displayed
preformatted.} 1114958883


#--------------------------------------------------
# #undata

page #undata {The "<m>#undata</m>" [directive] ends a block of data text.
See the "<m>[#data]</m>" page for more information.} 1111979433


#--------------------------------------------------
# #unpre

page #unpre {The "<m>#unpre</m>" [directive] ends a block of [preformatted text] that began
with "<m>[#pre]</m>".  See the "<m>[#pre]</m>" page for more information.} 1098501857


#--------------------------------------------------
# #unTcl

page #unTcl {The "<m>#unTcl</m>" [directive] ends a block of Tcl code on a [User Code]
page.  See the "<m>[#Tcl]</m>" page for more information.} 1098544667

#--------------------------------------------------
# about-notebook

page about-notebook {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>about-notebook</m>

= Description =

Loads the "About Notebook" page into the [help browser].

This is equivalent to selecting Help/About Notebook from the application menu.

= Examples =

<m>about-notebook</m>

= Implementation =

[@showproc about-notebook@]} 1115583968


#--------------------------------------------------
# Advanced Features

page {Advanced Features} {The following topics describe how to get the most use of Notebook through
by extending it to meet your needs.  Most of these features involve using
one or more [Notebook Commands].

* [Magic Button]s
* [Embedded Macro]s
* [Customizing the User Menu]
* [Customizing the Edit Menu]
* [Defining New Commands]
* [The Tcl Language]} 1111725533


#--------------------------------------------------
# askfor

page askfor {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>askfor <i>prompt</i></m>

= Description =

Writes the <i>prompt</i> to the status line, and then lets the user
enter a response.  When the user presses Enter, the response is returned.
If the user cancels the input by pressing Escape, the entire command
will be cancelled.

See also [request], which is [askfor] on steroids.

= Examples =

The following command asks for your name, and [insert]s it into the
editor.  You could add it to your [editmenu].

#Tcl
proc insert-name {} {
    insert [askfor "Your name"]
}
#unTcl

= Implementation =

[@showproc [current]@]} 1114961175


#--------------------------------------------------
# assert

page assert {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature assert@]

= Description =

The [assert] command defines an "assertion": a logical statement that
must be true if you've not made any coding errors.  If the statement is
not true, then [assert] throws an error and you can see a full stack
trace in the [Message Log]

A judicious use of [assert] can make it much easier to debug your code.

See also [require].

= Examples =

Suppose you've added some procs to your [User Code] page.  One of the
procs defines a helper command that should only be called by your other
procs:

#pre
proc DoSomethingToAPage {name} { ... }
#unpre

As you've designed your code, it's a programming error to call <m>DoSomethingToAPage</m>
for a page that doesn't exist.  You can indicate this clearly by using
an assertion:

#pre
proc DoSomethingToAPage {name} {
    assert {[pageexists $name]}
    .
    .
    .
}
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc assert@]} 1114961188


#--------------------------------------------------
# back-page

page back-page {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>back-page</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

While browsing pages, displays the previously-browsed page.  Calling
this command is equivalent to pressing the "back" button.

= Examples =

Inserted into a page, the following [magic button] will take you back
to whichever page you'd been looking at previously:

#pre
[%Go Back!|back-page%]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc back-page@]} 1115584008

#--------------------------------------------------
# Bulleted Paragraph

page {Bulleted Paragraph} {One common use of Notebook is to create lists of things.  To create a 
bulleted list, just put a "*" at the beginning of each entry (the * has to be
in the first column of the line).

* First bullet
* Second bullet
* Third bullet.  Note that a bullet item can be very short, or it can be an
  an entire paragraph.  If the text is so long that it has to wrap to a second
  or third line, or even longer, all of the lines will be indented properly
  under the first line.

You can even create outlines--lists with multiple levels of indentation--just
by entering as many "*" characters as you want indents.  If your page
contains this, for example,

 * First level
 ** Second level
 *** Third level
 **** Fourth level

then it displays like this:

* First level
** Second level
*** Third level
**** Fourth level

You can indent up to nine levels.} 1027183868


#--------------------------------------------------
# cancel-edits

page cancel-edits {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>cancel-edits</m>

= Description =

While editing a page, cancels your edits and returns to browsing.  If
you've made any changes you'll be asked to confirm that you want to
abandon them.

This is equivalent to pressing the "X" button on the [page editor]'s
toolbar, or the Escape key.

= Examples =

<m>cancel-edits</m>

= Implementation =

[@showproc cancel-edits@]} 1115584033


#--------------------------------------------------
# clipboard

page clipboard {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>clipboard ...</m>

= Description =

<m>clipboard</m> is a built-in Tcl/Tk command for accessing the system
clipboard; see the official Tcl/Tk documentation for specifics.

= Examples =

Here are some simple uses of the clipboard command.  To clear the clipboard:

#pre
clipboard clear
#unpre

To copy a text string to the clipboard:

#pre
clipboard clear
clipboard append "My string"
#unpre

To retrieve the contents of the clipboard:

#pre
set text [clipboard get]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc clipboard@]} 1114961237


#--------------------------------------------------
# close-window

page close-window {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>close-window</m>

= Description =

Closes the current window; if the current window is the last one, exits
the application altogether.

This is equivalent to selecting File/Close Window.

= Examples =

<m>close-window</m>

= Implementation =

[@showproc close-window@]} 1115584057


#--------------------------------------------------
# codeget

page codeget {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>codeget ''name''</m>

= Description =

Retrieves and returns all Tcl code from the named page, that is, all
text between <m>#Tcl</m> and <m>#unTcl</m> [directives].  If the page
does not exist, or contains no Tcl code, <m>codeget</m> returns the
empty string.

<b>Warning:</b> this command expands and parses the named page.
Calling it from an [embedded macro] for the particular page in which 
the macro is embedded might cause Notebook to hang.

= Examples =

#pre
set usercode [codeget "User Code"]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc codeget@]} 1115584079


#--------------------------------------------------
# Color Preferences

page {Color Preferences} {Notebook uses many different text colors, each with its own specific purpose.  
On the Colors tab of the User Preferences dialog box you can select the 
foreground and background colors you prefer for each purpose: 

= Page Browser Colors =

These settings are used by the [page browser].

* <b>Normal Text</b>: Normal text.
* <b>Title Text</b>: Page titles.
* <b>Preformatted Text</b>: Blocks of preformatted text or data.
* <b>Tcl Code</b>: Blocks of Tcl code.

#--------------------------------------------------
# Creating a Daily Log

page {Creating a Daily Log} {I find that one of the best ways I have of keeping organized and on top of
what I'm doing is to keep a daily log.  On the top of the page I keep my
"to do" list; the remainder of the page consists of my log entries, listed
by day in reverse chronological order.  Before I wrote Notebook, I kept my
log using a normal text editor and one long text file; this was convenient
in some ways, but very unwieldy in others, particularly when it came time to
trim the file and move the older log entries into archival storage.

Fortunately, Notebook automates the whole process for me.  It automatically
stores the entries for a specific day in a page of their own for ease of
searching and editing, but also makes a "main log" page that displays
my "to do" list (and anything else I'd like), the most recent seven 
entries in the log, and then an index list of all of the old entries.
More than that, I can have separate logs on as many subjects as I like.

= Creating a new log page =

* Decide what you'd like your main log page to be called.  Mine is called
  "To Do".

* Put a link to the page on your Home page, and click on it to create
  the page.  See [Creating links to other pages] and [Creating new pages].

* Put whatever text you'd like at the top of the page: your to do list, a
  list of projects, or whatever you'd like--or nothing.

* At the bottom of the page, type in this:

#pre
[@lb@]logpage[@rb@]
#unpre

* <m>[logpage]</m> is an [embedded macro] that turns the page into a log
  page.  It does all of the heavily lifting for you.

* Save the page.  When it displays, you'll see the words "Edit Today's Entry"
  at the bottom of the page.

* To edit today's entry, click on "Edit Today's Entry".  Notebook will
  automatically create a new page for the day's entry, and take you to the
  editor.  The first line of the new page will look something like this:

#pre
[@lb@]logentry "To Do" 2002-07-20[@rb@]
#unpre

* Leave this line at the top of the page!  [logentry] is an
  [embedded macro] that makes the page part of your daily log.

* Add whatever you'd like to the bottom of the page, and save it.

* You'll be taken back to your main log page--and now, your first entry will
  be there. Note that it automatically begins with today's date.

= Using your log page =

To browse your log, or add new entries, just go to your main log page.

* To edit the text at the top of the page, edit the page as you would any
  other page.

* To edit today's entry, or to create an entry for today, just click on
  "Edit Today's Entry".

* To edit a previous entry, click on the word "edit" on the same line as its
  date.  To view a previous entry as a separate page, click on the word
  "view" on that same line.

* If I'm editing the current day's entry frequently, I'll often click on
  the word "view" to view the entry page, and then just edit it as a
  normal page.

That's all there is to it!} 1114142245


#--------------------------------------------------
# Creating links to other pages

page {Creating links to other pages} {Notebook's most prominent feature is the ability to link pages together.
You've been using this feature quite a bit as you read through this
on-line help material.

To create a link from one page to another page, edit the first page and
type the other page's name in square brackets where ever you'd like the
link to be.  For example, to create a link to your Home page you'd type this:

#pre
[Home]
#unpre

When you save the page, you'll see that you've created a link.  Click on it,
and it will take you to the page you chose.
Links are normally shown in blue text.

Sometimes you want to link to a page, but you want to use something
other than the page's name as the link text.  For example, to link to
your Home page as "My Home Page", you'd type this:

#pre
[My Home Page|Home]
#unpre

Everything before the vertical bar character ("|") is displayed;
everything after is the page name to which you want to link.

Note that you can't put a link in [preformatted text], because that's 
always displayed exactly just the way you typed it, including the brackets.} 1114141522


#--------------------------------------------------
# Creating New Pages

page {Creating New Pages} {You can create a new page in several ways.

The most useful way to create a new page is simply to enter a link to it on
some existing page.  Your Home page is often a good choice; some people
like to create a New Pages page for this purpose.  The best place for the
link is on some page related to your new page.  See 
[Creating links to other pages] for how to create a link.  

A link to a nonexistent page looks [like this].  Not only do the 
the bracket characters appear, but they are colored differently than the
rest of the link.  This is a reminder to you that the page doesn't exist.

To actually create the page, just click on the link.  Notebook will ask
if you want to create it.  Type "y" into the status line, and press the
return key, and Notebook will open the editor for the new page.  See
[Editing an existing page] for more on editing pages, and [Notebook
Markup] for how to make you page look the way you want it to.

Alternatively, you can select the Page/Edit Page... menu item, and
Notebook will ask you for the name of the page to edit.  Type it into the
status line and press return, and Notebook will open the editor for the
new page.} 1072222873

# current

page current {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>current ?''num''?</m>

= Description =

By default, returns the name of the page you're currently browsing or
editing.  The command has some significant additional behavior when
used in an [embedded macro], based on the value of the <i>num</i>
argument; you'll only care about this if you have pages that expand and

<m>level</m>
: <m>current</m> returns the number of pages in the expansion stack.

<m><i>n</i></m>
: If <i>n</i> is a number less than <m>&lb;current level&rb;</m>,
  returns the name of the <i>n</i>th page in the expansion stack,
  counting from the top of the stack.  Note
  that <m>&lb;current 0&rb;</m> is thus the name of the page that
  contains the [embedded macro] that called <m>current</m>.

<m><i>#n</i></m>
: If <i>n</i> is a number less than <m>&lb;current level&rb;</m>,
  returns the name of the <i>n</i>th page in the expansion stack,
  counting from the bottom of the stack.  Note
  that <m>&lb;current #0&rb;</m> is thus the name of the topmost page 
  that is being expanded, i.e., the page being expanded so that it can
  be parsed and displayed in the [page browser].

= Examples =

The [logpage] command derives the name of [logentry] pages from the
name of the [current] page.

On a [logentry] page, <m>&lb;current&rb;</m> will return the page's
name when it's displayed in the [page browser], but the [logpage]'s
name when the [logentry] is displayed as part of the [logpage].

On the other hand, <m>&lb;current 0&rb;</m> will return the [logentry] page's name
regardless of how the [logentry] page is displayed.

<m>cut-string</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

Whenever you're editing text, [cut-string] will cut the selected text
onto the clipboard just like the Edit/Cut menu item does.

[cut-string] is most useful as an item on your [editmenu].

= Examples =

Placed in your [User Code Page], the following code will define an
editor context menu with one item:

= Description =

While browsing, invoking this action repeatedly will cause the browser
to cycle through the last ten or so pages you've looked at during the
current session.

This action is equivalent to selecting Page/Cycle Through Recent Pages.

= Syntax =

[@signature dbfile@]

= Description =

[dbfile] returns the absolute path name of the current notebook file.

= Examples =

[dbfile] can be useful if you want to pass the notebook file to some
external program.  For example, on a Unix system the following magic
button would do a CVS commit of your notebook file:

#pre
[%Commit|exec cvs commit -m"Backup" [dbfile]%]

# dbsave

page dbsave {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature dbsave@]

= Description =

Saves the contents of the current notebook to disk.  The notebook is
saved automatically whenever you edit, rename, or delete a page;
however, if you write code that directly manipulates the contents of
your notebook it might not get saved immediately.

The documentation for each [notebook command] that affects the content
of your notebook will indicate whether the command saves the notebook
or not.  In general, high-level commands like [newpage], [rename-page]
and [delete-page] save the notebook; low-level commands like [pageset],
[pagedelete] and [pagerename] do not.

= Examples =

The following magic button will remove all text from the current page
(including the button itself) and save the notebook.

#pre
[%Clear This Page%|pageset [current] "" ; dbsave%]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc dbsave@]} 1114961907


#--------------------------------------------------
# Defining new commands

page {Defining new commands} {= Introduction =

Part of Notebook's power is that you can extend it to suit yourself by defining
new commands in [the Tcl language].  If you're a diehard Tcl programmer, then
or course you could do this by getting the Notebook source and modifying it
as you chose; but even a normal user can extend Notebook without touching
the original source code.  

Be warned, though: extending Notebook is a kind of programming, and you have to
be ready to deal with the consequences of mistakes in your code.  If you're
new to Tcl programming, you might want to experiment in a separate notebook
that doesn't contain your important data, and copy your successes over as
you perfect them.

= The User Code Page =

Every notebook contains a page called "User Code" that exists to contain
your own custom [Notebook commands].  You can display "User Code" in any
of the normal ways, or you can select the <b>Magic / User Code</b> menu
item.

The "User Code" page always contains at least one line, that looks like
this:

<m>[#Tcl] -- Enter new commands below</m>

You can put any kind of text you like at the top of the page, ahead of the
"[#Tcl]" line; you can put your own Tcl code after it.

The magic of the "User Code" page is that the Tcl code on it is automatically
loaded whenever you open the notebook, so the commands you define there are
automatically available on all of your other pages.

To add new code, just edit the "User Code" page.  When you're done, save it;
you can reload it by selecting the <b>Magic / Load User Code</b> menu item.

Then try your new commands in [magic button]s and [embedded macro]s.

= Adding Additional Code Pages =

You don't need to put all of your Tcl code in the "User Code" page.  If there's
something you're working on that you don't want loaded automatically at
start up, put it on its own page, preceded by a <m>[#Tcl]</m> directive.  
You can load the code once you've written it using the 
<b>Magic / Load Current Page</b> menu item.

Once you've debugged your new code, you can copy it to your "User Code" page;
or, alternatively, you can leave it where it is and put a
<m>[load-page]</m> command on the [User Code] page to load it at start
up.  The <m>[load-page]</m> command should follow the <m>[#Tcl]</m>
directive on the [User Code] page.
For example, 

#pre 
#Tcl
load-page "User Code: More Code"
#unpre

If the new code page will execute commands defined on your [User Code]
page ''as it loads'', then the <m>[load-page]</m> command should follow
those command definitions.  If all your new code page does is define new
commands or call existing [Notebook Commands], then the <m>[load-page]</m>
command can go anywhere on the page.

= Your First New Command =

An [embedded macro] is really just a Tcl command that returns some text; the
text replaces the macro when the page is displayed.  Here's a simple macro
that returns the day and time.  You can copy it into your "User Code" page
just as you see it here.

#pre
proc dayAndTime {} {
    set now [clock seconds]
    return [clock format $now -format "%A, %I:%M:%S %p"]
}
#unpre

Unfortunately, any lengthy discussion of [the Tcl language] is beyond the
scope of this help document.

= Debugging Your Code =

As soon as you start programming, you'll find that you need to debug your
code.  Notebook offers you two tools: the [Message Log] window and the
[msg] command.

The [Message Log] is a scrolling log of all messages written to the
status line at the bottom of the Notebook Window, with the newest
messages at the top.  [msg] is a [Notebook Command] that adds messages to
the log.  If you're trying to figure out what's going on in your code,
it's often useful to sprinkle it with calls to [msg].} 1115589667


#--------------------------------------------------
# delete-page

page delete-page {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>delete-page ?''name''?</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

Deletes a page from your notebook, and saves the notebook.  If
<i>name</i> is given, <m>[delete-page]</m> deletes and the named page and
returns immediately; otherwise, <m>[delete-page]</m> prompts the user to enter
a page name, and then asks them to confirm that the page should be
deleted.

If you wish to delete many pages at one time, use <m>delete-pages</m>
instead.

= Examples =

Pressing the following [magic button] would cause the current page to
be deleted.

#pre
[%Delete Me|delete-page [current]%]
#unpre

This one, on the other hand, will prompt the user for a page to delete.

#pre
[%Delete Something|delete-page%]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc delete-page@]} 1116795614


#--------------------------------------------------
# delete-pages

page delete-pages {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>delete-pages ?<i>pages</i>?</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

Deletes a list of pages from your notebook, and saves the notebook.  If
no list of page names is given, <m>delete-pages</m> will delete the pages
whose names are selected in the [Index Sidebar].  Either way, the user is
asked to confirm whether the specified pages should be deleted or not.

= Examples =

The following bit of code would delete all pages whose names include the
word "Cheese".

#pre
delete-pages [pages *Cheese*]
#unpre

= Implementation =

#--------------------------------------------------
# Directives

page Directives {A directive is a special command to Notebook about the current page.
Every directive begins with a "#" character in the first column on a line.
The remainder of the line is the directive proper.  At present, Notebook

* <m>[#---]</m>
* <m>[#rem] <i>comment text</i></m>
* <m>[#meta] <i>name</i> <i>value</i></m>

* <m>[#data] <i>type</i> ?<i>name</i>? ?<i>args</i>?</m> ... <m>[#undata]</m>

Most directives affect the way the page is displayed; by default, though,
the directives themselves are not.  Directive display can be enabled on
the [Miscellaneous preferences] tab of the [User Preferences] window.

If Notebook does not recognize a directive (e.g.,

  #NotADirective

it will displayed as preformatted text.} 1114216925

# Editing an existing page

page {Editing an existing page} {You can edit a page in several ways:

* Navigate to the page, and press the "Edit" button on the toolbar;
  this button shows a pencil over a piece of paper.
* Click on a link to an undefined page.
* Select the Page/Edit Page... menu item, and type in the name of the

Once you're editing a page, you can use the normal editing keys for your
platform.  When you're done editing, type Ctrl+S, or press the
"Checkmark" button on the toolbar. See
[Page Editor] for more on using the editor.

Note that Notebook doesn't display the text you enter quite the way you type it.
Instead, it makes it easy to create links and other special things.  See
[Notebook Markup] for information on how Notebook displays what you type.} 1114967688

# editmenu

page editmenu {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature editmenu@]

= Description =

Defines the editor context menu.  You can access the items on this menu
by right-clicking in the [page editor].  The <i>menuitems</i> argument
is a list of item labels and [notebook commands]--clicking on the label
will execute the associated command.  If the item label is the single
word "separator", then a separator will be added to the menu instead of
a normal item.

[editmenu] returns the current list of items.

= Examples =

If you included the default set of pages in your notebook when you
created it (the set that includes the "Tour"), then your [editmenu] was
initially defined like this:

#pre
editmenu {
    Undo             undo-change
    Redo             redo-change
    separator {}
    Cut              cut-string
    Copy             copy-string
    Paste            paste-string
    "Insert Page..." insert-page

Suppose you have a page called "My Template" that contains boilerplate
you like to include in a number of pages.  The following code 
adds an item to insert it:

#pre

# Editor Preferences

page {Editor Preferences} {This tab allows you to set parameters that affect the behavior of
Notebook's page editor.

<b>Tab Width</b>: Pressing the Tab key inserts space characters until the next tab stop
is reached.  By default, tab stops are every four spaces; you can
choose any tab width you like.

<b>AutoWrap</b>: Notebook doesn't wrap text as you insert and delete letters, 
like a word processor; rather, it respects the carriage returns
you enter, and preserves them just as you enter them.  If AutoWrap is
enabled, however, pressing the space bar or the return key near the
end of the line will cause that line to be wrapped to the next line.

<b>Wrap Column</b>: The "wrap column" is used when AutoWrap is enabled; it determines
approximately how long individual lines should be.  It defaults to 74
characters.

<b>AutoIndent</b>: It's often desirable to indent a line to match its predecessor.  If
both AutoWrap and AutoIndent are enabled, then wrapped lines are
automatically indented to match the previous line.  In addition,
if AutoIndent is enabled then pressing Tab at the very beginning of
the line indents to match the previous line.} 1114224376

# Embedded Macro

page {Embedded Macro} {An embedded macro is a special command you insert into a page in special
brackets, 

#pre
[@lb@]Like this[@rb@]
#unpre

When the page is displayed, the macro 
gets replaced with something else.  
If you were to go to the Index page and edit it, for example, you'd see 
this: 

#pre
[@lb@]pageIndex[@rb@]
#unpre  

[pageIndex] is a [Notebook Command] that 
produces an index of the pages in your Notebook.  You can use it in your
own pages, too.  

For example, suppose you'd created a bunch of pages about
a kitchen remodel that you were planning.  You could put an index of all
of them on your main Kitchen Remodel page by including the macro

#pre
[@lb@]pageIndex *Kitchen* [@rb@]
#unpre

--- assuming that all of the page names
included the word "Kitchen".

Notebook has a number of [Notebook Command]s you can use as embedded
macros, and you can define your own commands as well.
The typical use for a macro is to format up some dynamic text for display in 
your page.  In this case, the macro should return text that follows the 
[Notebook Markup].  You can also write macros that take some special 
action whenever you view the page.

Be aware, macros are expanded <b>before</b> any formatting is done; 
consequently, macros will be expanded even if they appear in 
[preformatted text].

= If you have problems... =

It's quite possible to write an embedded macro that makes a page
unviewable, or that might even hang up the Notebook application
altogether. Consider the following:

#pre
[@lb@]while 1 {msg "Oh, No!"}[@rb@]
#unpre

If you go to a page that contains this macro, Notebook will hang as the
macro writes "Oh, No!" to the status line infinitely many times.  Should
you encounter this kind of problem, here's what you can do:

* Kill the Notebook application as best you can.
* Restart Notebook and open the notebook file.
* Select the Page/Edit Page... menu item, and type in the name of the
  page containing the problem macro.
* Edit or delete the problem macro, and save the page.

This should handle most problems--unless, of course, the problem macro is
on your Home page.  In that case, you need to disable embedded macros altogether:

* Restart Notebook without specifying a notebook file.
* Uncheck "Expand Macros?" on the Magic menu.
* Open the notebook file.
* Edit the problem page as described above.
* Once you're sure it's OK, check "Expand Macros?" on the Magic menu
  again.} 1114222918


#--------------------------------------------------
# Explicit Line Break

page {Explicit Line Break} {Normally, Notebook treats a set of consecutive lines beginning with
normal text as a paragraph, which is wrapped for attractive display. 
Consider the following input, in which each line is clearly meant to
be separate:

#pre
<b>Title:</b>  Badgers
<b>Author:</b> Brock Marshworthy
#unpre

Here's what it ends up looking like:

<b>Title:</b>  Badgers
<b>Author:</b> Brock Marshworthy

To fix this, you can insert an explicit line-break with the <m>&lt;br&gt;</m>
tag:

#pre
<b>Title:</b>  Badgers<br>
<b>Author:</b> Brock Marshworthy
#unpre

This breaks the line without breaking the paragraph:

<b>Title:</b>  Badgers<br>
<b>Author:</b> Brock Marshworthy

The <m>&lb;br&rb;</m> tag also works within bulleted and indented
paragraphs:

#pre
* <b>Title:</b>  Badgers<br>
<b>Author:</b> Brock Marshworthy
#unpre

The second line is properly indented.

* <b>Title:</b>  Badgers<br>
<b>Author:</b> Brock Marshworthy

If you want to begin a new, unindented paragraph at a point where
Notebook would not ordinarily break paragraphs, you can put a "-"
(optionally followed by some whitespace) as the first character on the
line:

#pre
* This is a bulleted paragraph.
This is a continuation of the bulleted paragraph.

* This is a bulleted paragraph.
- This is an unindented paragraph
#unpre

As you can see, "-" at the beginning of the line 
forces a new paragraph to start, just as "*" and ":" do.

* This is a bulleted paragraph.
This is a continuation of the bulleted paragraph.

* This is a bulleted paragraph.
- This is an unindented paragraph} 1115516942

# export-notebook-as-html-set

page export-notebook-as-html-set {#rem action
= Description =

This action exports each page in a Notebook file to HTML, one HTML file
per page, with links between the different pages.  The user is prompted
for a directory in which to create the HTML files; if the directory
isn't empty, the user will be told so and asked whether or not to
export the Notebook.

Each page will begin and end with a navigation bar, with links to the
"Home" page, the "Index" page, and the next and previous pages in 
alphabetical order by page name.

The page file names are based on the page names, as follows:

* ".html" is added on the end.

* The name is converted to lower case, e.g., "Home" becomes "<m>home.html</m>".

* All whitespace in the page's name is replaced with underscores, e.g.,
  "Recent Changes" becomes "<m>recent_changes.html</m>".

* If there's a conflict between two names, an extra underscore and
  number are added to one of them.  For example, suppose your Notebook
  contained pages called "This And That" and "This_And_That".  From
  Notebook's point of view these are two different names, but following
  the above rules yields the same string, "<m>this_and_that.html</m>".  One of
  them will become something like "<m>this_and_that_1.html</m>".

# Exporting a Notebook to HTML

page {Exporting a Notebook to HTML} {The entire contents of a Notebook file can be exported to HTML in one of
two ways: as a single HTML file, or as a set of HTML files, one per
Notebook page.  The conversion of Notebook markup to HTML is done just as

* Page links become HTML hyperlinks

* Navigation aids are added.

This export capability is still very bare-bones; if there are
enhancements you'd like to see, please post them at the [Notebook Wiki].

#--------------------------------------------------
# Exporting a Page to HTML

page {Exporting a Page to HTML} {Notebook pages can be exported to HTML in several ways (see [Exporting
Notebook Pages] and [Exporting Entire Notebook Files] for important background material):

* A single page can be exported or copied to the clipboard as a single
  HTML file.

* A single page can be exported or copied to the clipboard as HTML text,
  suitable for pasting into a larger HTML file.

* The entire Notebook can be exported as a single HTML file, with
  hyperlinks between the pages.

* The entire Notebook can be exported as a set of HTML files, one per
  Notebook page, with hyperlinks between the pages.

Regardless of the method is used, there are some strategies that carry
over, especially if the HTML output is to be used "as is", rather than as
the basis for further editing.  

= Export Formats and Embedded Macros =

For example, it will often be the case that you'd like to have different 
things appear on a page when displayed in your notebook than on a
webpage. If you have a [Daily Log], for example, the daily entries
include [magic button]s labeled "Edit" and "View".  HTML has no
equivalent to Notebook's "Edit" capability, and the "View" button could be
replaced in HTML by a standard page link.

It's easy to build a page that varies based on where it's being exported
by using [embedded macro]s and the <m>[exportformat]</m> command.  Here's
a simple example:

#pre
proc entry_buttons {topage} {
    if {[string match "html-*" [exportformat]]} {
        return "(\[View|$topage\])"
    } else {
        return "(\[View|$topage\], \[%Edit|edit-page [list $topage]\%]"
    }
}
#unpre  

= Preformatted HTML =

When writing HTML-aware macros, you'll sometimes want to expand them
directly to HTML, instead of expanding to Notebook markup for Notebook to
convert to HTML.  Suppose, for example, you want to use HTML's
<m><span></m> tag to mark a span of text in some.  The difficult is that
Notebook doesn't recognize arbitrary HTML tags, and assumes that it
should convert the "<" and ">" characters to the HTML <m>&amp;lt;</m> and
<m>&amp;gt;</m> attributes so that they'll display as is.

This, clearly, is not what you want.  There are two ways around it.

== The <html>...</html> Tags ==

Within a paragraph, you can tag a span of text as HTML, like this:

#pre
<html><span class="special">This is special text</span></html>
#unpre

The <m>&lt;html&gt;</m> and <m>&lt;/html&gt;</m> tags are not displayed
by Notebook, and are completely ignored except when the page is being
exported to some form of HTML.  In this case, the tagged text is exported
to HTML mostly unchanged--that is, page links and so forth are converted,
but the "<" and ">" characters are left alone.

Because these tags are ignored most of the time it's safe to use them in
ordinary Notebook pages.

== The #data html...#undata Directives ==

If you've got a large block of HTML text you'd like to export unchanged,
you can use the <m>[#data]...[#undata]</m> directives to bracket it as an
HTML data block.  The
text will be passed to the HTML output '''unchanged in any way.''' 
Consider the following:

#pre
#data html
[Not a Page Link]
#undata
#unpre

If this HTML data block were used in a page, Notebook would display it
like this:

#data html
[Not a Page Link]
#undata

In other words, normal Notebook markup is completely ignored within an
HTML data block.  For this reason, HTML data blocks are usually produced
by an [embedded macro], and only when the [export format|Exporting
Notebook Pages] is <m>html-file</m> or <m>html-text</m>.} 1114287964

# Exporting Entire Notebook Files

page {Exporting Entire Notebook Files} {Although Notebook understands a number of [export formats|Exporting
Notebook Pages], it is only possible at present to export the entire
contents of a Notebook as HTML.  See [Exporting a Notebook to HTML] for
more details.} 1113449496


#--------------------------------------------------
# Exporting Notebook Pages

page {Exporting Notebook Pages} {Individual Notebook pages can be exported in two ways--by copying the
page's text to the clipboard using the <b>Copy Page</b> submenu of the
[Edit Menu], or by saving the page's text to a file using the
<b>Export</b> submenu of the [Page Menu].  

= Export Formats =

Pages can be exported in any of the following formats:

<b><m>raw</m></b>: The exported text is the raw markup of the page, just
as you'd see it and edit it in the [Page Editor].  This is appropriate
for copying a page from one Notebook to another.

<b><m>expanded</m></b>: Expanded markup is just like raw markup except
that all embedded macros have been expanded.

<b><m>plain</m></b>: Notebook expands and formats the page as prettily as it can as
plain text.  Header text is formatted as capital letters; the other text
styles are ignored.  Magic buttons are discarded, and of course there are
no page links.  This is appropriate for copying a page into an
e-mail message.

<b><m>html-page</m></b>, <b><m>html-text</m></b>: Notebook does its best
to format the page in HTML.  All text styles are honored, but magic
buttons are discarded and there are no page links.  There are two options
for HTML output--as HTML body text, suitable for pasting into a longer
HTML document, and as a standalone HTML page. See [Exporting a Page to
HTML] for more details.

<b><m>mediawiki</m></b>: Notebook translates the page's expanded markup
into [MediaWiki] markup, suitable for pasting into the [Notebook Wiki].

= Export Formats and Embedded Macros =

By using the <m>[exportformat]</m> command in an [embedded macro], you
can write Notebook pages that expand to different markup depending on the
destination.  For example, here's an embedded macro that expands to a
page link if the page will be displayed by Notebook, but capitalizes the
page name if the page is being exported as <m>plain</m> text:

#pre
proc pagelink {page} {
    if {[exportformat] eq "plain"} {
        return [string toupper $page]
    } else {
        return "\[$page\]"
    }
}

is dedicated to some topic of interest to you.  The "Home" page is your main
point of departure; you'll usually use it to list the major topics within
your notebook.  Notebook pages can be linked together in any way you like,
like pages on a website, so that from any page you can
immediately jump to any related page.

The best way to get started using Notebook is by creating a new notebook
and examining the pages that Notebook puts in it automatically; you should
especially browse through the "Tour" pages.  Once you've seen what Notebook
can do, you should look through the next few [Basic Features].

Once you've mastered those, reading the [Advanced Features] and [Reference] pages
will help you use Notebook to your best advantage.} 1114968022

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

While browsing, calling goto-next-page with no arguments will take you to
the page that follows the current page.  If you specify a page
<i>name</i>, then it will take you to the page that
follows the specified page.  

By default, the ordering of pages is determined by the contents of the
[Index Sidebar].  If the sidebar is displaying an alphabetical index of
all pages in the notebook, <m>goto-next-page</m> will take you to the
next page in alphabetical order.  If the sidebar is displaying search
results in time-sorted order, <m>goto-next-page</m> will take you to the
next-most-recently-edited page in the list.

Alternatively, you can go to the next page in a chosen set of pages by
specifying a <i>pattern</i> which page names must match.  This is 
independent of the contents of the [Search Box], and is always
alphabetical.

# Indented Paragraph

page {Indented Paragraph} {You can indent a paragraph by putting a colon (":") as its first character.
Just as with [bulleted paragraph]s, the number of colons determines the level
of indentation (up to 9).  For example, if you type in the following 
(putting the first colon in the first column of the line),

#pre
:: This paragraph is indented two levels
#unpre

Then you get this:

:: This paragraph is indented two levels.

You can use indentation to create topic lists.  Put the topic on the first
line, and maybe put it in boldface (see [Text Styles]); then, indent
the description.  In other words, this

#pre
<b>Fruitbats</b>
: Fruitbats are frequently found flying about frozen fjords.....
#unpre

gets you

<b>Fruitbats</b>
: Fruitbats are frequently found flying about frozen fjords....

You can also use the colon to add a second or third paragraph to a 
[bulleted paragraph] (although an [explicit line break] might be better). 
For example, this

#pre
* Bulleted paragraph

: Continuation of bulleted paragraph
#unpre

gets you this:

* Bulleted paragraph

: Continuation of bulleted paragraph} 1114294569

# Index

page Index {[@pageIndex@]} 1026257630


#--------------------------------------------------
# Index Sidebar

page {Index Sidebar} {The Index Sidebar opens up on the right-hand side of the browser window
whenever Notebook needs to display a list of page titles, e.g., when the
Index toolbar button is pressed, or a search string is entered in the
[Search Box].  While browsing, you can double-click on any listed page to
go to that page.

To delete a set of pages, select their names in the Sidebar and then
select the <b>Page / Delete Pages...</b> menu item.  You'll be asked to
confirm that you want to delete the pages, and if you say yes they'll be
deleted for good.

= Sidebar Controls =

The sidebar can be controlled via the [Sidebar Menu], or by its own
toolbar buttons:

* The "A to Z" button sorts the contents of the Sidebar alphabetically.

* The "clock" button sorts the contents of the Sidebar chronologically,
  from most-recently-edited to least-recently-edited.

* The "left-triangle" button closes the Sidebar.

Just under the Sidebar's toolbar it indicates the sort order and whether 
it is showing the full index or just search results.

= Page Order =

The Sidebar's content controls the effect of the <m>[goto-next-page]</m>
and <m>[goto-previous-page]</m> [User Interface Actions], whether invoked
from the [Page Menu] or by their keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+N and Ctrl+P.

In plain English, Ctrl+N and Ctrl-P take you to the next and previous page
in the notebook, as defined by the content and sort-order of the Sidebar.
This makes it really easy to step through the pages found in a search.} 1116795819


#--------------------------------------------------
# indexlist

page indexlist {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature indexlist@]

= Description =

Given a list of page names, <m>indexlist</m> returns the markup for
an index list: a bulleted list of page names and modification times. 
It's the basis for commands like <m>[pageIndex]</m> and
<m>[searchIndex]</m>.

= Examples =

The following macro would expand to a pretty list of the 
pages whose names contain the word "Jabberwock":

#pre
[@lb@]indexlist [pages "*Jabberwock*"][@rb@]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc indexlist@]} 1114961940


#--------------------------------------------------
# Inline Images

page {Inline Images} {As of version 2.1.2, Notebook can display image files!  Unfortunately
there are some reasonably severe restrictions and caveats (which
is why Notebook didn't have this capability ''until'' version 2.1.2).

= Restrictions on Inline Images =

By default, Notebook can only display "GIF" images.  In order to display
BMP, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF images as well, you'll need to acquire and
install the [TkImg Extension].

Second, display of JPEG images, especially large JPEG images, is
'''extremely slow'''.  Really truly amazingly extremely slow, so slow you
probably don't want to try it.  This is due to a bug in the current
version of either Tcl/Tk or the [TkImg Extension], I'm not sure which. 
In the meantime, we shall all just have to live with it.

Third, Tcl/Tk has only minimal built-in support for resizing images.  If
you want to display an image that's really too large to fit on the page,
you can specify a maximum width and height.  Notebook will ensure that the
displayed image is no larger than the maximum; but it might be smaller,
and the image quality may suffer.

It might be possible to mitigate some of these restrictions in future
versions; the problem is, most of the solutions require platform-specific
binary code, which I'm not really in a position to support.

= Displaying Inline Images =

To include an image in your page, you use the following markup:

: <m>&lb;!image <i>fileName</i> ?<i>options...</i>!&rb;</m>

The ''filename'' can be an absolute path name or a relative path name; if
relative, it's assumed to be relative to the location of the Notebook
file.  For example,

#pre
[!image hello.gif!]
#unpre

will include an image called "hello.gif", which must be found in the same
directory as the Notebook file, while in

#pre
[!image images/hello.gif!]
#unpre

the image must be found in the "images" directory, immediately below the
directory containing the Notebook file.  Note that forward slashes "/"
work just fine as directory separators, even on Windows.

= Image Options =

You can add the following options after the image file name:

<m><b>-width <i>pixels</i></b></m><br>
<m><b>-height <i>pixels</i></b></m>
: These options set the maximum width and height for the displayed image.
  If necessary, the image will be reduced in size by subsampling every
  ''n''th pixel such that the new width and height are no bigger than
  those specified here.  Note that the image height and width are always
  reduced proportionally, so it's often only necessary to specify one of
  these options.

<m><b>-padwidth <i>pixels</i></b></m>
: This option is used to pad the left and right
  sides of the image by a specified number of <i>pixels</i>.

<m><b>-text <i>altText</i></b></m>
: Specifies the alternate text for the image.  This text is shown on the 
  status line when you mouse over the image; it's also included when the
  page containing the image is exported to HTML.} 1115570603


#--------------------------------------------------
# insert

page insert {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>insert ''string''</m>

= Description =

While editing, inserts <i>string</i> into the editor at the insertion point.

= Examples =

The following command, if called while editing, will insert a timestamp
into the page you're editing.

#pre
proc insertTimestamp {} {
    set now [clock seconds]
    return [clock format $now -fmt "%H:%M:%S"]
}
#unpre

Such a command could become an item on your [editmenu].

#--------------------------------------------------
# insert-page

page insert-page {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>insert-page ?''name''?</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

While editing, calling this command is equivalent to selecting
Edit/Insert Page from the application menu.  If <i>name</i> is given,
the text of the named page will be inserted into the page you are
editing at the insertion point.  Otherwise, Notebook will prompt you
for the name of a page to insert.

= Examples =

[insert-page] is especially useful on your [editmenu].  For example,
you can create a number of "template" pages containing boilerplate you
re-use frequently, and then add an "Insert" item to the [editmenu] for
each:

#pre
editmenu {
    .
    .
    .
    "Insert My Template" {insert-page "My Template"}
    .
    .
    .

# Link Bars

page {Link Bars} {A "link bar" or "navigation bar" is a set of links placed concisely on
one line, and often separated by vertical bars ("|").  It usually appears
at the top or bottom of the page.  The link text is often an abbreviation
of the linked page name.

If you have a number of pages devoted to a particular project, you can
make navigating them easier by adding a link bar at the top of each page;
the link bar should link to the most important project pages.

= Creating a Link Bar =

The easiest way to create a link bar is just to type it in.  For example,

#pre
[Commands|Notebook Commands]|[Buttons|Magic Button]
#unpre

displays as

[Commands|Notebook Commands]|[Buttons|Magic Button]

Alternatively, you can use the [linkbar] command, which creates [magic
button]s rather than normal page links; page links are better, though, as
they get updated automatically when you rename a linked page.

= Reusing a Link Bar on Several Pages =

If you want to use a link bar on several pages (and you probably do), you
don't want to have to type it fresh each time; the time will come when
you want to add or delete a page, it should really be defined in one
place.

The best thing to do is to put the link bar on its own page, and then 
include it into the pages that need it using an [embedded macro].  Of
course, you could simply define the link bar as an [embedded macro] to
begin with; but if it has a page to itself it will get 
updated automatically if you rename one of the linked pages.

So, suppose you've got a link bar on a page called "Link Bar: My Project".
You can include it in any page you like using the following macro:

#pre
[@lb@]pageget "Link Bar: My Project"[@rb@]
#unpre

If that's too verbose, define a command just for this purpose:

#pre
proc projlinks {} {
    pageget "Link Bar: My Project"
}
#unpre

Then you can include the link bar with this much short macro:

#pre
[@lb@]projlinks[@rb@]
#unpre} 1114295924


#--------------------------------------------------
# linkbar

page linkbar {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature linkbar@]

= Description =

Formats a "link bar" or "navigation bar" of magic buttons.  Use it
to create navigation aids to your more important pages.  The
<i>linklist</i> is a list of "label", "pagename" pairs.

= Examples =

For example,

#pre
[@lb@]linkbar {Commands "Notebook Commands" Buttons "Magic Button"}[@rb@]
#unpre

This macro expands to the following link bar:

[@linkbar {Commands "Notebook Commands" Buttons "Magic Button"}@]

The most usual way to use <m>linkbar</m> is by defining a new command on
your User Code page, and then using that command as an [embedded macro] on
the pages where you want the link bar to appear

Judicious creation and use of link bars can make your Notebook easier
to navigate; the one downside is that the links are [magic button]s,
and therefore will not be renamed if the linked pages are renamed.

See also [Link Bars].

# load-page

page load-page {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>load-page ?''name''?</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

Loads your Tcl code from the named page; if no name is given, Notebook
will prompt you for a page name.  

[load-page] only works for pages which contain the <m>[#Tcl]</m> directive.

= Examples =

If you write much "user code", your [User Code Page] will quickly
become too large for comfort.  The easiest solution is to create
additional pages, and have your [User Code Page] load them explicitly. 
For example, suppose you write a new command called "insert-timestamp".
You could put it on a page called "User Code: insert-timestamp", and
add the following line to your [User Code Page] (following the <m>[#Tcl]</m>

# logentry

page logentry {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature logentry@]

= Description =

This [embedded macro] marks the current page as an entry in the daily log
whose main page is called <i>logname</i>.  The <i>date</i> argument 
indicates which entry it is; it must have the form "yyyy-mm-dd" where
"yyyy" is the year, "mm" is the month, 01-12, and "dd" is the day of the
month, 01-31.

This macro is seldom entered manually into a page; it's inserted into
each day's new entry automatically when the
"Edit Today's Entry" button is pushed.

= Examples =

See [Creating a Daily Log] for more.

= Implementation =

[@showproc logentry@]} 1114962008


#--------------------------------------------------
# logpage

page logpage {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature logpage@]

= Description =

Included as an [embedded macro], this command turns the page into a
[Daily Log].  The first seven log entries are displayed in their entirety;
older pages are listed by date.  

= Examples =

See [Creating a Daily Log] for more information.

= Implementation =

# lshift

page lshift {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature lshift@]

= Description =

Pops the first element from a Tcl list stored in <i>listvar</i> and
returns it; the element is removed from the list.  If the list is
empty, returns the empty string.

This command is useful in reading variable length argument lists.

= Examples =

Consider the following Tcl code:

#pre
set mylist {red green blue}
set color [lshift mylist]
#unpre

The value of "color" will be "red", and the value of "mylist" will be
{green blue}.

# Magic Button

page {Magic Button} {A Magic Button is a special kind of link.  Instead of linking to another
page, clicking on the Magic Button executes a command: one of the standard
[Notebook Commands], or a command of your own from your [User Code Page].  Magic buttons are typed into
a page like this:

#pre
[%Button Text|Command to Execute%]
#unpre

For example, the following Magic Button uses the [help-on] command to link
to the main [Help] page while displaying the text "Notebook Help":

#pre
[%Notebook Help|help-on Help%]
#unpre

If you put this in a page, it would look like this: 
[%Notebook Help|help-on Help%].  As you can see, it looks like a link, but
a link of a different color.} 1114296377

# Miscellaneous Preferences

page {Miscellaneous Preferences} {The Miscellaneous tab of the [User Preferences] dialog box contains the
following options, which can be turned on or off by clicking in the check
box:

<b>Include "Tour" and other introductory material in new notebook
files</b>: If this option is checked (as it is by default), then the
introductory material will be included in any new Notebook files you
create.  If it is not checked, the new Notebook files will contain a
minimal set of pages, including Home, Index, Search, Recent Changes, and
User Code. 

<b>Begin editing with the cursor at the bottom of the page</b>: If this
option is checked, then whenever you edit a page in the [Page Editor] the
cursor will initially be positioned at the bottom of the page. 
Otherwise, the cursor will initially be positioned at the  top of the
page (the default).  Note that in all versions of Notebook prior to 2.1.1
the cursor was always positioned at the bottom of the page.

<b>Display "#" directives in the Page Browser</b>: By default, "#"
[directives] are not displayed by the page browser except via their
side-effects, e.g., the lines between <m>[#pre]</m> and <m>[#unpre]</m>
are displayed as preformatted text.  If this option is checked, then all
"#" [directives] will be displayed.

<b>Create new pages on link click without prompting</b>: If you click on
a link to a nonexistent page, Notebook will normally tell you that the
page doesn't exist and ask if you'd like to create it.  If this option is
checked, Notebook will assume that you'd like to create the page and will
take you directly to the [page editor] without any prompting.

<b>Open the Index Sidebar at startup</b>: If this is checked, the [Index
Sidebar] will be opened automatically for each [Page Browser] window. 
Otherwise (the default) the [Index Sidebar] will be opened only on
request, e.g., to display search results.

<b>Use Incremental Search by default</b>: If this is checked (the
default), the search results will be updated and displayed with each
character entered in the [Search Box].  Otherwise, the search results
will be displayed only when your press Enter in the [Search Box].

Note that this setting may be changed temporarily on the [Search Box]'s 
pull-down.

<b>Search both page titles and content by default</b>: If this is checked
(the default), any text entered in the [Search Box] will be matched
against both the title and content of each page; otherwise, only page
titles will be matched.

Note that this setting may be changed temporarily on the [Search Box]'s
pull-down.} 1114967280

<m>msg ''text''</m>

= Description =

Writes the specified <i>text</i> to the [Message Log]; in addition, the
first line of text will appear in the window's status line.

Your [notebook commands] can use [msg] to tell you things; it's also
useful for debugging.

<m>newpage ''name'' ?''template''?</m>

= Description =

Creates a new page called <i>name</i>, which contains the specified 
<i>text</i>, and returns the <i>name</i>.  The page is not displayed;
to create and display the new page, use [goto-page].

= Examples =

The following code creates a new page called "My New Page", which will
initially contain the string "My Template Text", and then displays it.

#pre
goto-page [newpage "My New Page" "My template text"]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc newpage@]} 1115585105


#--------------------------------------------------
# nextpage

page nextpage {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>nextpage ''?page?'' ''?pattern?''</m>

= Description =

Returns the name of the page that follows the specified page; <i>name</i>
defaults to the current page.

By default, the ordering of pages is determined by the contents of the
[Index Sidebar].  If the sidebar is displaying an alphabetical index of
all pages in the notebook, <m>nextpage</m> will return the name of the
next page in alphabetical order.  If the sidebar is displaying search
results in time-sorted order, <m>nextpage</m> will return the name of
the next-most-recently-edited page in the list.

Alternatively, you can specify a <i>pattern</i> which page names must match.  This is 
independent of the contents of the [Search Box], and is always
alphabetical.

See also: <m>[prevpage]</m>, <m>[goto-next-page]</m>.

= Examples =

For example, the following command returns the
name of the page that follows "Nacho Cheese" in the set of pages that
have "Cheese" in their names:

#pre
nextpage "Nacho Cheese" "*Cheese*"
#unpre

If there is no subsequent page in the chosen set, <m>nextpage</m>
returns the empty string.

# Notebook Markup

page {Notebook Markup} {Unlike most word processors, Notebook is not "WYSIWYG": What You See isn't
exactly What You Get.  WYSIWYG is very nice when you're trying to precisely
control the printed output, but it makes a number of things much harder--like 
inserting links to other pages.  Consequently, Notebook lets you edit a page as
plain text, with a few simple conventions for indenting, creating headers and 
bulleted lists, and adding links to other pages.

For the most part, you type block paragraphs like you normally would:
a paragraph is just a sequence of lines ending with a blank line.  You can type
carriage returns yourself, or just let the text wrap; either way, Notebook will
wrap the text nicely while you're browsing.

You can do many other things, too:

#--------------------------------------------------
# pagedelete

page pagedelete {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pagedelete@]

= Description =

Deletes a specified page from the Notebook, but does not save the Notebook
to disk.  Because <m>pagedelete</m> doesn't save the Notebook, it's
useful when deleting many pages at once; after all have been deleted,
call <m>[dbsave]</m> to save the changes.

In most ordinary circumstances, however, <m>[delete-page]</m> is a more
appropriate choice.

= Examples =

The following magic button would cause the current page to be deleted
and the Notebook saved.

#pre
[%Delete Me|pagedelete [current]; dbsave%]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc pagedelete@]} 1114962029


#--------------------------------------------------
# pageexists

page pageexists {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pageexists@]

= Description =

Returns 1 if there's a page called <i>name</i> in the current notebook,
and 0 otherwise.

Note that the query is case-insensitive; if there's a page called "My
Page", then 

#pre
pageexists "my page"
#unpre

would return 1.

= Examples =

It's often useful to check whether a page exists before trying to do
something with it.

= Implementation =

[@showproc pageexists@]} 1114962032


#--------------------------------------------------
# pageexpand

page pageexpand {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>pageexpand ''name''</m>

= Description =

Retrieves the unformatted text of the named page, first expanding any
[embedded macro]s.  It's an error if the page doesn't exist.  If any
macro contains an error, it will appear unexpanded in the returned text.

Note that this command will expand the page's macros regardless of the
setting of the <b>Magic/Expand Macros?</b> menu item. 

See also [pageget].

<b>Warning:</b> this command expands the named page.
Calling it from an [embedded macro] for the particular page in which 
the macro is embedded might cause Notebook to hang.

= Examples =

See the implementation of [logpage].  [logpage] uses [pageexpand] to
retrieve each of the log entries.

= Implementation =

[@showproc pageexpand@]} 1115585185


#--------------------------------------------------
# pageget

page pageget {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pageget@]

= Description =

Retrieves the unformatted text of the named page, without expanding any
[embedded macro]s.  It is an error if the page doesn't exist.

See also [pageexpand].

= Examples =

The following command writes the raw text of the current page to a disk
file called "file.out":

#pre
proc saveCurrentPage {} {
    set f [open file.out "w"]
    puts $f [pageget [current]]
    close $f
}
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc pageget@]} 1114962038


#--------------------------------------------------
# pageIndex

page pageIndex {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pageIndex@]

= Description =

This [embedded macro] expands into a formatted alphabetic list 
of pages whose titles match the specified pattern, 
which can contain wildcard characters.  If <i>pattern</i> is omitted, then
the list will include every page in the notebook.

See also [pages] and [indexlist].

= Examples =

The standard [Index] page consists of the following embedded macro:

#pre
[@lb@]pageIndex[@rb@]
#unpre

The following macro expands into an index of the pages that contain
the word "Cheese" in their title:

#pre
[@lb@]pageIndex *Cheese*[@rb@]
#unpre

The wildcard "*" characters are very important; without them, the only
page the index would ever contain would be one called "Cheese".

= Implementation =

[@showproc pageIndex@]} 1114962040


#--------------------------------------------------
# pagerename

page pagerename {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pagerename@]

= Description =

Renames a specified page from the Notebook, but does not save the Notebook
to disk.  Because <m>pagerename</m> doesn't save the Notebook, it's
useful when renaming many pages at once; after all have been renamed,
call <m>[dbsave]</m> to save the changes.

In most ordinary circumstances, however, <m>[rename-page]</m> is a more
appropriate choice.

= Implementation =

[@showproc pagerename@]} 1114962043


#--------------------------------------------------
# pages

page pages {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pages@]

= Description =

If no <i>pattern</i> is given, [pages] returns an alphabetical list of the
names of the pages in the notebook.  The list is intended to be
processed by additional commands; for example, <m>indexlist</m> will
format it as a bulleted list.

If <i>pattern</i> is given, only pages that match the pattern will be
included.

See also: <m>[pageIndex]</m>, <m>[indexlist]</m>, <m>[pagesbytime]</m>.

= Examples =

The following call will return a list of the pages whose names include the word "Lego":

#pre
pages "*Lego*"
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc pages@]} 1114962046


#--------------------------------------------------
# pagesbytime

page pagesbytime {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pagesbytime@]

= Description =

[pagesbytime] is equivalent to [pages], except that the pages are
sorted from most recently edited to least recently edited instead of alphabetically.

See also: <m>[pageIndex]</m>, <m>[indexlist]</m>, <m>[pages]</m>.

= Examples =

For example, the following call will return a list of the
pages whose names include the word "Lego", in time-sorted order.

#pre
pagesbytime "*Lego*"
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc pagesbytime@]} 1114962049


#--------------------------------------------------
# pagesearch

page pagesearch {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pagesearch@]

= Description =

Returns a list of the names of the pages whose names or bodies
contain the <i>searchText</i>.  The names are in alphabetical order.
The returned list is intended to be processed further; for example, 
<m>indexlist</m> will format it as a bulleted list.

See also: <m>[indexlist]</m>, <m>[searchIndex]</m>, and
<m>[showsearch]</m>; contrast with [pages] and [pageIndex].

= Examples =

The following call returns a list of the pages whose name or body
includes the word "Cheese":

#pre
pagesearch "Cheese"
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc pagesearch@]} 1114962052


#--------------------------------------------------
# pageset

page pageset {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pageset@]

= Description =

Sets the body text for page <i>name</i> to <i>value</i>.  If the page
already existed, <i>value</i> replaces its previous content; if the
page didn't exist, it is created.

Note that the change isn't saved to disk automatically; if you want to
ensure that your change is saved, call [dbsave] afterwards.

If you want to ensure that you're creating a new page and not
overwriting the content of an existing page, use [newpage] instead of [pageset].

= Examples =

Suppose you wanted to add a link to the bottom of a page, separated from
the bulk of the page by a horizontal bar.  The following code would do
the trick:

#pre
set text [pageget "My Page"]
append text "\n#---\n\[My New Link\]"
pageset "My Page" $text
dbsave
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc pageset@]} 1114962054


#--------------------------------------------------
# pagetime

page pagetime {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature pagetime@]

= Description =

Returns the time the page was last edited.  If <i>format</i> is
omitted, the time will be expressed in standard Unix format, as the
number of seconds since the epoch.  If given, <i>format</i> is a Tcl
"clock format" string, and the output will be a formatted time and or
date. See the Tcl "clock" man page for full details.

= Examples =

The following command will format the Home page's last edit time as
"MM/DD/YY HH:MM:SS", on a twenty-four-hour clock:

#pre
pagetime Home "%D %T"
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc pagetime@]} 1114962057


#--------------------------------------------------
# parse

page parse {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>parse <i>text</i></m>

= Description =

This command parses a text string containing [Notebook Markup] and
returns a tagged list containing the parsed text.  I intend to document
the tags and structure of the parsed text eventually, but for now it
must remain TBD.

Be warned: the structure of the parsed list is one of the things most
likely to be modified from one version of Notebook to another, so use
this command with care.

= Examples =

#pre
set taglist [parse [pageexpand "Home"]]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc parse@]} 1114962060


#--------------------------------------------------
# paste-string

page paste-string {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>paste-string</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

While you're editing a page, [paste-string] pastes the text from the
clipboard into the editor.

[paste-string] is most useful as an item on your [editmenu].

= Examples =

Placed in your [User Code Page], the following code will define an
editor context menu with a Paste item.

#pre
editmenu {
    Paste {paste-string}
}
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc paste-string@]} 1115585205


#--------------------------------------------------
# Preformatted Text

page {Preformatted Text} {Sometimes you want to type in some text and have it display just exactly as
you typed it.  Most of the examples in this [Notebook Markup] pages are entered
as preformatted text, so that you can see how to type them.  Also, preformatted
text is always displayed in a <m>monospace</m> font, so that things like tables
line up properly:

 Item         $/Dozen
 ===========  =======
 Fruitbats    $  5.95
 Armadillos   $ 27.95  
 Chupacabras  $199.94

There are two ways to enter preformatted text.  The first way is
to type a space (" ") as the first character of a paragraph.  
The preformatted paragraph will continue to the next blank link,
[bulleted paragraph], or [indented paragraph].  By convention you should
put a space (" ") at the beginning of each line of the paragraph, but this
isn't strictly necessary.

For longer blocks of preformatted text you can use the <m>[#pre]</m> and
<m>[#unpre]</m> [directives] at the beginning and end of the block.

Be aware that you can't put [text styles], links to other pages,
or [magic button]s into a preformatted paragraph; [embedded macro]s, however,
will be expanded as usual.} 1098501824


#--------------------------------------------------
# prevpage

page prevpage {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>prevpage ?''page''? ?''pattern''?</m>

= Description =

Returns the name of the page that precedes the specified page; <i>name</i>
defaults to the current page.

By default, the ordering of pages is determined by the contents of the
[Index Sidebar].  If the sidebar is displaying an alphabetical index of
all pages in the notebook, <m>prevpage</m> will return the name of the
previous page in alphabetical order.  If the sidebar is displaying search
results in time-sorted order, <m>prevpage</m> will return the name of
the prior page in the list.

Alternatively, you can specify a <i>pattern</i> which page names must match.  This is 
independent of the contents of the [Search Box], and is always
alphabetical.

See also: <m>[nextpage]</m>, <m>[goto-previous-page]</m>.

= Examples =

For example, the following command returns the
name of the page that precedes "Nacho Cheese" in the set of pages that
have "Cheese" in their names:

#pre
prevpage "Nacho Cheese" "*Cheese*"
#unpre

If there is no previous page in the chosen set, <m>prevpage</m>
returns the empty string.

= Implementation =

[@showproc prevpage@]} 1115585238


#--------------------------------------------------
# Recent Changes

page {Recent Changes} {[@recentChanges@]} 1026526241


#--------------------------------------------------
# recentChanges

page recentChanges {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature recentChanges@]

= Description =

This [embedded macro] expands into a formatted alphabetic list 
of pages whose titles match the specified pattern, 
which can contain wildcard characters.  If <i>pattern</i> is omitted, then
the list will include every page in the notebook.

The pages are listed from most recently edited to least recently edited.

See also [pages] and [indexlist].

= Examples =

The standard [Recent Changes] page consists of the following embedded macro:

#pre
[@lb@]recentChanges[@rb@]
#unpre

The following macro expands into an index of the pages that contain
the word "Cheese" in their title:

#pre
[@lb@]recentChanges *Cheese*[@rb@]
#unpre

The wildcard "*" characters are very important; without them, the only
page the index would ever contain would be one called "Cheese".

= Implementation =

[@showproc recentChanges@]} 1114962066


#--------------------------------------------------
# redo-change

page redo-change {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>redo-change</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

While editing, calling [redo-change] will redo the last set of undone edits;
it's equivalent to selecting Edit/Redo from the application menu.

= Examples =

[redo-change] is mostly useful as an item on your [editmenu].

= Implementation =

[@showproc redo-change@]} 1115585249

= Syntax =

<m>refresh-this-page</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

While browsing, causes the currently displayed page to be redisplayed. 
As such, it's roughly equivalent to

#pre

# Release Notes

page {Release Notes} {= Notebook [@version@] Release Notes =

Start Notebook and select "Topics" from the "Help" menu for
documentation on how to use Notebook.

The Notebook home page is at http://notebook.wjduquette.com

This version of Notebook is fully usable; I use it myself, daily.
However, it contains a number of experimental and undocumented 
features, and should be considered a work in progress.  Some of
the undocumented features might be changed, removed, or replaced
in the next version.

Meanwhile, though I'm not aware of any bugs it's likely some
are lurking; and there are many features and enhancements I've not
gotten to yet.  Please don't be shy about telling me about problems
you have or features you'd like to see.  You can send me
information by e-mailing me at will@wjduquette.com; or, better yet,
post at them at the Notebook home page (see above).  Also, 
you might want to join the Notebook Mailing List so you'll see
the announcements of new releases.  (Again, see the Notebook
home page).

== Installation ==

This version of Notebook is delivered as an executable for 
Windows systems, as a native executable for Mac OS X systems 
(10.3 or later) and as a Starkit for all other systems.  To use 
Notebook on a Windows system, just execute notebook.exe.  You
might wish to associate it with the ".nbk" file type.  To use
Notebook on Mac OS X, just drag the Notebook application to your
application folder.

For other systems, you'll need to download "notebook.kit" and 
the TclKit runtime for your platform from
http://www.equi4.com/pub/tk/8.4.9.  Put the TclKit runtime on
your path, and mark notebook.kit executable.

If you have any questions, bug reports, suggestions, or comments,
feel free to contact me, Will Duquette, at will@wjduquette.com,
or post them at the Notebook Wiki, http://notebook.wjduquette.com.

== Changes in Version 2.1.3 ==

* MacOSX: New application and document icons.  Thanks to
  Kevin Walzer for pointing the way!
* New feature: the [Index Sidebar].  The page index
  and search results are now shown in a sidebar on the right hand side
  of the window.
** The page index, the search box, and the search results are now
  available all of the time, even while editing pages.
** The Search and Recent Changes pages are no longer required.  
   They will no longer be included in new notebooks, and may 
   safely be deleted from old notebooks.  Note that if you use
   such a notebook file with an older version of Notebook, the 
   Search and Recent Changes pages will be recreated
   automatically.
** The <m>goto-index</m> and <m>goto-recent-changes</m> 
   [User Interface Actions] are now deprecated.
** You can now search just page titles, or (the default) both page
   titles and content.
** Presenting the search results in the Sidebar is '''much''' faster
   than the older method; hence, incremental search is now the
   default.
** The Next Page/Previous Page keys (Control-N, Control-P) now work
   with the Sidebar's list.  You can now step through pages
   alphabetically or in time order from most recent to least recent,
   and you can step through all pages or the current search results.
** New [Sidebar Menu]

* Reorganized the [Page Menu] for quicker access
  to the most common choices.

* Keyboard access to the [Search Box].
** The [find-string] action now works through the 
   [Search Box].

* New menu item: '''Page / Delete Pages...'''
** This menu item will delete the set of pages selected in the
   [Index Sidebar] (first prompting for confirmation).   

* New [Miscellaneous Preferences]:
** The sidebar may be open or closed in new windows by default.
** Search may be incremental or non-incremental by
   default. 
** Search may be by page title only or by both page title
   and content by default.

* Notebook now scrolls large images much better
  than it used to. Thanks to Wayne Mogg for coming up with the fix!
  As a side-effect, the image "-padheight" option has been removed.

* New Actions/Notebook Commands:
** delete-pages
** searchtext
** show-index
** show-recent
** sidebar
** sidebar-byname
** sidebar-bytime
** sidebar-close
** sidebar-open

* Bug Fix: Excess whitespace is no longer removed in link and
  magic button text.

* Bug Fix: Notebook's keyboard shortcuts now work properly whether
  CapsLock is enabled or not.

* Bug Fix: "-" markup for explicit line breaks.  I added this markup
  in V2.1.1, and then took it out again in V2.1.2 in favor of
  &lt;br&gt;.  However, I only took out half of the code, so that
  "-" still caused a line/paragraph break, but also appeared in the
  output.  Enough people have spoken in favor of "-", though, that
  I reinstated it rather than removing it completely.

* Bug Fix: When invoked from the command line, Notebook can now open
  multiple notebooks at the same time, as it is suppose to do.

* Bug Fix: Notebook's fonts are oddly sized on some systems.  You can
  now fix this by adjusting the "Tk Scaling Factor" on the 
  [Scaling Preferences] tab of the [User Preferences] window.

* Newly Deprecated:
** goto-index
** goto-recent-changes

* The implementation of browser-specific Notebook Commands has 
  been extensively revised.  The new code is simpler, shorter, and
  should be easier to maintain; it's also the first step toward 
  securing the User Code interpreter such that you can load Notebooks
  from unknown sources without worrying about what their User Code
  might do to your system.
** As a result, the "browser" Notebook Command is no longer needed.
   Because it does represent a security hole, and should never have
   been used directly by User Code anyway, it has been deleted 
   rather than deprecated.  If you were using "browser" directly
   for some reason, contact me and I'll see if I can provide an
   alternate mechanism.

* The following Notebook commands were deprecated in Notebook 2.0.1
  and have now been deleted from the application
** backpage
** editpage
** editnewpage
** includecode
** message
** renamepage
** showhelp
** shownext
** showpage
** showprev

== Changes in Version 2.1.2 ==

* New Feature: Inline Images!  Include images in
  your Notebook pages using the new markup:

: <m>&lb;!image path/to/file ?<i>options...</i>?!&rb;</m>

  By default, Notebook understands only GIF images; with the
  optional [TkImg Extension] you also get BMP, JPEG, PNG, and
  TIFF files.  (See the on-line help for more information about
  getting the [TkImg Extension].)  Note that the Mac OS X
  version of Notebook already includes the [TkImg Extension].

* New Notebook Command: <m>html</m>.  Allows
  you to control how Notebook exports HTML; in particular, allows
  you to define CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) styles.  '''Note:'''
  this command is experimental; it is likely to change in the
  next version.  It's not documented, but you can take a look at
  the [User Code] page of this on-line help for an example.

* New Markup: &lt;br&gt; for explicit line breaks.  The "-" markup I
  introduced in 2.1.1 has been removed; I can add it back in
  if folks like it.

* New Markup: #rem directive.  "rem" stands for "remark"; #rem
  directives are used to add comments to Notebook pages.  #rem
  directives are not displayed or exported (unless all directives
  are displayed).

* Bug fix: Notebook export to HTML no longer fails if two Notebook
  pages clash.

* Bug fix: #meta directives were displayed as preformatted text in
  pages converted to HTML or MediaWiki markup.

* Bug fix: MediaWiki export no longer misformats bulleted paragraphs.

* Bug fix: Notebooks created without the Tour are now loaded
  successfully.

* Bug fix: Explicit line breaks are now formatted properly on HTML
  export -- provided you use the new <br> markup instead of the "-"
  markup.

* Bug fix: Selection of specially formatted text (e.g., #pre and 
  #Tcl) is now visible.  (Thanks to Vsu for pointing out the fix!)

* Bug fix: In HTML export, headers now close indentation properly.

* Bug fix: In HTML export, "<", ">", and "&" are now escaped 
  properly in headers.

* Bug fix: Links to non-existent pages are now highlighted when
  the Notebook is exported to HTML.

== Changes in Version 2.1.1 ==

* New splash screen.  The splash screen image was donated
  by Tomek Wojtowicz.

* The on-line help now contains documentation for many changes
  made but not documented in 2.1.0.  The relevant changes are listed
  under "Changes in Version 2.1.0" and are marked "Documented in
  2.1.1".

* New Feature: Export the entire notebook to HTML!  
  The output is still rather basic, but it's a start.  There are two 
  new menu items:
** File/Export/As Single HTML File...
** File/Export/As Set of HTML Files...

* The [User Code] page in the on-line help shows how to use the
  #Tcl/#unTcl directives to better document your Tcl code.

* The Preferences dialog is now a normal toplevel window instead
  of a dialog.

* Added "User Interface Actions" to the Help menu.

* New Preference: Create new pages silently on link click.  Normally,
  if you click on a link to a page that doesn't exist then Notebook
  will ask you if want to create it.  If you check this box on the
  Miscellaneous tab of the Preferences window, Notebook will take you
  straight to the page editor instead.

* New Feature: the status line's prompt now has a yellow background
  when it's waiting for you to answer a question or enter some input;
  this should make it easier for new users to spot.

* New Preference: A long time ago, I made Notebook default to
  putting the cursor at the end of the page when you edit a page,
  because I was tired of moving the cursor there manually.  Since
  then, I've gotten tired of moving the cursor to the beginning of the
  page manually.  So I've changed the behavior to default to leaving
  the cursor at the beginning of the edited page.  If you prefer the
  old behavior, there's a new option on the Miscellaneous tab of the
  Preferences window.

* New Preferences: you can now specify foreground and background
  colors for preformatted text and Tcl code on the Colors tab
  of the Preferences window.

* New Preference: you can turn display of "#" 
  directives on and off.  It is now off by default.

* New Feature: Whenever search text is entered in
  the search entry field at the top of the page browser, any matching
  text in the browsed page will be highlighted.  You may select the
  highlight colors you prefer on the Colors tab of the Preferences
  window.

* New Markup: Explicit line breaks.  If a line begins with "-", 
  Notebook will always cause it to begin on a new line.  The "-" and 
  any subsequent whitespace are not displayed.

* New Markup: Multi-level section headers.  Notebook now
  allows three levels of header in a page:

  = Level 1 =
  == Level 2 ==
  === Level 3 ===

: The first "=" character must be at the beginning of the line, and
  the header text must be separated from the "=" characters by at
  least one space.  The final "=" must be the last thing on the line.
  If any of these constraints are not met, the header will be
  formatted as normal text, "=" characters and all.

* New Markup: Wiki-like markup for bold and italic text:

  ''Italic''
  '''Bold'''
  '''''Bold and Italic'''''

* New Preference: Fonts for header levels 1, 2,
  and 3.  Note that the in-line header markup, 
  "&lt;h&gt;...&lt;/h&gt;", is displayed in the level 3 header font.

: If you've used prior versions of Notebook, all three header fonts
  will be set to the single header font you'd chosen previously.  Use
  the Preferences window to select the specific fonts you'd like.

* New Export Format: MediaWiki Markup.

* New Notebook Commands:
** [codeget]
** [copy-page-as]
** [copy-this-page-as]
** [export-page-as]
** [export-this-page-as]
** [help-on-actions]

* New User Interface Actions:
** [help-on-actions]
** [copy-page-as-mediawiki]
** [copy-this-page-as-mediawiki]
** [export-page-as-mediawiki]
** [export-this-page-as-mediawiki]
** [export-notebook-as-html-file]
** [export-notebook-as-html-set]

* Updated Command: [current]
** The [current] command now allows embedded macros to know the page
   in which they are embedded, as well as the page in which they will
   be displayed.  This is useful when writing code that builds up a
   page (like a Daily Log) from other pages.

* Bug Fix: On OS X with Tcl/Tk Aqua, having a tooltip pop up for a
  toolbar button should no longer cause the Notebook window to
  lose focus.

== Changes in Version 2.1.0 ==

* New Markup: You can have a page link whose link text differs
  from the page name.  For example, you can link to your "Home"
  page as "My Home Page" using the following markup:

   [My Home Page|Home]

* Support for international fonts.  This version of Notebook
  includes all of Tcl's Unicode encodings, and should therefore
  support a variety of character sets, including Chinese.

* New Feature: Magic/Load This Page will load
  the Tcl code from the current page even if you're currently editing
  the page.  In this case it will save your edits before loading the
  the code; you'll remain in the editor.  <i>Documented in 2.1.1</i>

* New Feature: Notebook now supports the #unpre directive, which
  allows multiple #pre/#unpre blocks of preformatted text on a page.

* New Feature: Notebook now supports the #unTcl directive. #Tcl/#unTcl
  work like #pre and #unpre, but bracket Tcl code instead instead of
  preformatted text.  User Code pages can now have multiple blocks of
  Tcl code interspersed with normal prose.

* New Feature: Edit/Copy Page submenu.  The
  items on this menu copy a page's content to the clipboard as
  plain formatted text, raw markup, markup with macros expanded, 
  HTML body text, or as a complete HTML page. <i>Documented in 2.1.1</i>

* New Feature: Page/Export submenu.  The items on
  this menu export a page's content to a text file as plain formatted
  text, raw markup, markup with macros expanded, HTML body text, or as
  a complete HTML page.  <i>Documented in 2.1.1</i>

* New Markup: &lt;html&gt;...&lt;/html&gt; <i>Documented in 2.1.1</i>
** Use these tags within a paragraph to mark text that should be
   exported to an HTML page "as is", e.g., text that already
   contains HTML markup.

* New Markup: #meta directive  <i>Documented in 2.1.1</i>

* New Markup: #data .. #undata   <i>Documented in 2.1.1</i>
** These directives are used to bracket arbitrary textual data just
   as #pre and #unpre bracket preformatted text.  The #data directive
   includes the data type name, which will allow for additional 
   processing.
** The contents of a data block are (at present) displayed as
   preformatted text.
** The only "data type" recognized by Notebook in any way at
   this time is "html"; on export to HTML, the contents of an
   "html" data block is exported as is.

* New User Interface Actions.  <i>Documented in 2.1.1</i>

** [exportformat]
** [formatas]
** [savefile]
** [getsavefile]
** [parse]

* Bug fix: Selecting File/Close Window from the Message Log window
  now closes the window as expected.

* Bug fix: Selecting "Cancel" from the Open Notebook or New Notebook
  dialogs no longer causes Notebook to halt.  (This only happened if
  open-notebook or new-notebook were invoked from the Welcome window.)

* Bug fix: If load-page finds an error in the loaded page, the error
  is now written to the status line and the Message Log window.

* Bug fix: You can now rename page "Fred" to "x-Fred" without error,
  and you can now delete "Fred" without deleting "x-Fred" as well.

* Bug fix: Pressing the "Save and Continue Editing" button in the
  Page Editor no longer causes other open Notebook browsers to pop
  up or take the focus unexpectedly.

* Bug fix: Previously, if you edited a page and then immediately
  tried to find a string on that page, the search always failed because
  the cursor was at the bottom of the page.  In this case, Notebook
  now starts searching from the top of the page, as you'd expect.

* Bug fix: In the page browser, the behavior of the Home and End keys 
  was erratic.  Home now scrolls to the top of the page and End to
  bottom, as expected.

* Bug fix: Previously, pasting text into the page editor could leave
  the insertion point off-screen.  The page editor now scrolls as
  necessary after each paste.

# rename-page

page rename-page {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>rename-page ?''oldname''? ?''newname''?</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

Renames the page named <i>oldName</i> to <i>newName</i>.  In addition,
it updates all links to <i>oldName</i> in your Notebook to refer to
<i>newName</i> instead, and saves all changes.

If <i>oldName</i> or <i>newName</i> are not specified, Notebook prompts
the user to enter them.

Contrast [rename-page] with [pagerename], which neither prompts the
user nor saves the changes.

= Examples =

The following call, used as a [magic button] or on your [usermenu],
will rename a page, prompting the user to enter both the old and new
names:

#pre
rename-page
#unpre

The following call will prompt the user to enter a new name for the
"Badly Named Page":

#pre
rename-page "Badly Named Page"
#unpre

Finally, the following call will simply give the "Badly Named Page" a better
name:

#pre
rename-page "Badly Named Page" "A Better Name"
#unpre

#--------------------------------------------------
# rename-this-page

page rename-this-page {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>rename-this-page ?''newname''?</m>

= Description =

Prompts the user for a new name for the current page, and then renames
the page and updates all links to it.

This action is equivalent to the Page/Rename This Page menu item.

= Examples =

#pre
rename-this-page "The New Name"

# replace-string

page replace-string {#rem command

= Syntax =

<m>replace-string</m>

= Description =

While editing, replaces for all occurrences of a string between the
insertion point and the end of the page with some other string. 
Prompts the user to enter both strings.

This action is equivalent to the Edit/Replace menu item.

= Examples =

#pre

#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc replace-string@]} 1115585325


#--------------------------------------------------
# request

page request {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>request ''options...''</m>

= Description =

The [request] command allows your code to prompt the user for
information.  It's a powerful, complex command; [askfor] is simpler to
use and might meet your needs.

[request] differs from [askfor] in the following ways:

* You can specify more than one prompt; the user will be asked for each
  in turn.

* For each prompt, you can specify a default response and a list of
  valid responses.

* Your request can be synchronous or asynchronous.  "Synchronous" means
  that the user must respond to all of the responses (or press Escape to
  cancel the request) before they can interact with the rest of the
  Notebook application.  "Asynchronous" means that they can interact
  with Notebook (e.g., they can go to a different page) and then go back
  to entering a response.  By comparison, [askfor] is always synchronous.

* By default the request is synchronous; [request] will return a list of
  the responses.  If the user presses Escape to cancel the request, the
  entire user-defined [notebook command] is cancelled.

* The request becomes asynchronous if the <m>-command</m> option is
  given; in this case, [request] returns nothing.

The prompts and associated data are specified by a list of options.  The
options can be specified in one of two formats:

: <m>request <i>option value option value...</i></m>

or

: <m>request {<i>option value option value...</i>}</m>

The latter form makes it easy to create a list of options and pass it to
[request]:

#pre
set options {}

if {$author eq ""} {
    lappend options -prompt "Author"
}

if {$title eq ""} {
    lappend options -prompt "Title"
}

set result [request $options]
#unpre

= Options =

[request] accepts the following options:

<m>-prompt <i>prompt</i></m>
: Defines a prompt.  The user will be prompted to enter a response using
  the specified <i>prompt</i>.  If multiple <m>-prompt</m> options are
  specified, the user will be prompted for each in the order of appearance.

<m>-enum <i>responses</i></m>
: Specifies a list of valid <i>responses</i> for the previous
  <m>-prompt</m>. If the user presses the
  Tab key, Notebook will attempt to complete any partial response
  they've entered by matching it against the <i>responses</i>.

<m>-strict 0|1</m>
: This option is used with <m>-enum</m>.  If <m>-strict 1</m>, then the
  only valid responses are those specified using <m>-enum</m>, and the
  user will not be allowed to enter anything else.  If <m>-strict 0</m>
  (the default) then the user can enter anything they like. 
  [delete-page] uses <m>-strict 1</m> when prompting a user to enter a
  page name, because you can't delete a non-existent page; [edit-page]
  uses <m>-strict 0</m> because it can be used to create new pages.

<m>-default <i>value</i></m>
: Specifies a default <i>value</i> for the previous <m>-prompt</m>.  If a default value
  is given, it will be highlighted in the status line when the user is
  prompted.  The user can accept the default by pressing Enter, or just
  start typing in their own response, in which case the default
  disappears.

<m>-command <i>command</i></m>
: By default, [request] prompts the user synchronously.  If this option
  appears, <i>command</i> should be a Tcl command which expects as many
  additional arguments as there are <m>-prompt</m> options.  Notebook
  will prompt the user for the options asynchronously; when all have
  been entered, Notebook will append the responses to the <i>command</i>
  and call it.

= Examples =

The following calls to [askfor] and [request] are equivalent.  Note
that [askfor] returns the response; [request] returns a list in which
the response is the first element:

#pre
set response [askfor "My Prompt"]
set response [lindex [request -prompt "My Prompt"] 0]
#unpre

The following code prompts synchronously for two values:

#pre
set responses [request -prompt "First" -prompt "Second"]
set first [lindex $responses 0]
set second [lindex $responses 1]
#unpre

The following code prompts for a page name; the page must exist, and
the default value is the current page:

#pre
set responses [request -prompt "Page" -enum [pages] -strict 1 -default [current]]
set name [lindex $responses 0]
#unpre

The following code prompts for a page name asynchronously; the user's
response will be passed to a command called DoSomething:

#pre
proc DoSomething {name} { ... }

request -command DoSomething -prompt "Page" -enum [pages] -strict 1 -default [current]
#unpre

#--------------------------------------------------
# request-action

page request-action {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>request-action</m>

= Description =

Prompts the user to enter the name of a [User Interface Action], and
then invokes the chosen action.

This action is equivalent to the File/Invoke Action menu item.

= Examples =

#pre
request-action
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc request-action@]} 1115585367


#--------------------------------------------------
# require

page require {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature require@]

= Description =

When writing procs in your [User Code Page], use [require] to check
conditions that must be true for your procs to execute correctly. 
[require] evaluates the <i>expression</i>; if the <i>expression</i> is
true then execution continues normally.  Otherwise, the <i>message</i>
will be written to the status line and to the [Message Log].

[require] is similar to [assert], except that [require] failures are
less severe.  If an [assert] fails, the presumption is that the
programmer made a mistake.  If a [require] fails, the presumption is
that the user asked for something that can't currently be done.

For example, [delete-page] is a high-level command for deleting a page.
If the user tries to delete a page that doesn't exist, that's a
[require] failure, and Notebook simply informs the user that the page
doesn't exist.  [pagedelete], on the other hand, is a low-level
command available only to your User Code.  If you use [pagedelete] to
delete a non-existent page, that's a programming error; Notebook will
write a complete stack trace to the [Message Log].

= Examples =

Suppose you were implementing your own version of the [insert-page]
command--you could implement it like this:

#pre
proc insert-page {name} {
    require {[pageexists $name]} "There's no page called '$name'!"
    insert [pageget $name]
}
#unpre

[pageget] is a low-level command, and will throw an error and
stack-trace if the named page doesn't exist.  The call to [require]
ensures that the user will get a nice error message instead.

Note also that you can only insert something into the editor if you're
editing a page--but you don't need to check this because the [insert]
command checks it for you.

#--------------------------------------------------
# Scaling Preferences

page {Scaling Preferences} {The '''Scaling''' tab of the [User Preferences] window allows you to
adjust the value of the Tk Scaling Factor.  You can enter a new value and
press "Apply"; the new value will take effect the next time you restart
Notebook.  Press "Restore Default Value" to restore Notebook's default
scaling factor for your computer.

= The Tk Scaling Factor =

In order to render your font choices properly (among other things),
Notebook needs to know the physical size of the pixels on your computer screen. 
The value it uses to do this is called the Tk Scaling Factor, and it's
measured in pixels-per-point.  One point is equal to 1/72 of an inch, so
the Tk Scaling Factor can also be thought of as the resolution of your
screen in pixels-per-inch (PPI) divided by 72.0.

Notebook does the best it can to determine the Tk Scaling Factor on its
own, but on some systems it's unable to get good data for the physical
dimensions of your computer screen.  If this happens you'll know because
Notebook will display its fonts at sizes which are out of proportion with
the other applications you use.

'''If you're happy with the size of your fonts, don't adjust the Tk
Scaling Factor.'''  But if the size is off from what it should be, read
on.

= Determining the correct scaling factor =

There are two methods for determining the correct Tk Scaling Factor.

== Method 1: Measure your screen. ==

Use an ordinary ruler to measure the width of your screen in inches.
The width of your screen in pixels is displayed on the '''Scaling''' tab
of the [User Preferences] window.  Then compute

               pixels
   factor = -------------
             inches*72.0

Alternatively, if you know the resolution of your screen in
pixels-per-inch, just divide that by 72.0.

Enter the result in the Tk Scaling field, and press Apply.  You'll need
to restart Notebook to see the difference.

== Method 2: Font Comparison ==

On some systems, Method 1 will fail--because the system doesn't try to 
display fonts at their full size.  On my Apple PowerBook, for example,
Method 1 gives me a scaling factor of about 1.4.  If I use that value,
though, Notebook displays fonts about 40% larger than other applications
do.  The default scaling factor is about 0.99, which turns out to be just
right.  Laptop screens are small, and your eyes tend to be closer to them;
text is legible at smaller sizes.  I suspect Apple did things this way so
that you can get more text on the screen.

If Method 1 fails then bring up another application--a word processor,
say--alongside Notebook, and have it display a known font--say, Arial
20pt.  Set Notebook to use the same font as its "Title Font".  Then 
adjust the scaling factor until Notebook displays the font at the same
size as the other application.  Note that you'll need to restart Notebook
in order to see the effects of changing the scaling factor.} 1117471465

# Search

page Search {[@searchIndex@]} 1026257614


#--------------------------------------------------
# Search Box

page {Search Box} {The Search Box appears in the middle of the [page browser] toolbar; you
can see it just above this page.  It's a long rectangle; at the left is
an icon of a magnifying glass over a piece of paper and a "down arrow"
icon; at the right (if there's any text in the Search Box) is an "x" in a
circle.

You can find out which pages contain any desired string in their names or
content by typing it into the Search Box.  The found pages will be
listed in the [Index Sidebar]; double-click on any page to browse it.

'''Note:''' Notebook searches the raw markup of each page, just as you'd 
see it in the [page editor].

You can activate the Search Box several ways--you can click on the page's
title (and thereby search for occurrences of the title on other pages);
you can click in the Search Box and start typing; or you can select
<b>Edit / Find</b> (Command-F on MacOSX, Control-F on other systems) and
start typing.

Whenever you view or edit a page, any text that matches the text in the Search Box
will be highlighted.  You can select the search highlight colors in the [Color
preferences] tab of the [User Preferences] window.

If you enter search text into the Search Box while editing a page,
pressing Return in the Search Box will take the focus back to the [page
editor] and move the insertion cursor to the next occurrence of the
search text.  Thereafter, <b>Edit / Find Again</b> will step through
subsequent occurrences.

To make the highlights go away, click the circled "x" at the right of the
Search Box or press Escape.  This will clear the search text and make the
highlights go away; the [Index Sidebar] will then list all pages in the notebook.

= Search Options =

Clicking on the black "down arrow" icon pops up the Search Options menu.

<b>Incremental Search vs. Non-Incremental Search</b>:  By default, 
Notebook updates the search results with each character you enter in the
Search Box.  This can be slow for large notebooks.  If you select
Non-Incremental Search, the search results will only be updated when
you press Enter in the Search Box.  If you prefer Non-Incremental Search,
you can disable Incremental Search
permanently on the [Miscellaneous Preferences] tab of the [User
Preferences] window.  It can then be re-enabled temporarily via this menu.

<b>Title and Contents vs. Title Only</b>:  By default, Notebook searches
both the title and contents of each page in your notebook.  You can limit
the search to the page titles by selecting Title Only.  If you prefer to
search only the page titles, you can disable content search permanently
on the [Miscellaneous Preferences] tab of the [User
Preferences] window.  It can then be re-enabled temporarily via this menu.} 1116796221

# Section Headers

page {Section Headers} {It's often desirable to break a long page into sections with section
headers.  Notebook gives you three
levels of section header:

= A Level 1 Header =

== A Level 2 Header ==

=== A Level 3 Header ===

You can select any [any font you like|Font Preferences] for each kind of header.

The markup for these three kinds of header looks like this:

#pre
= A Level 1 Header =

== A Level 2 Header ==

=== A Level 3 Header ===
#unpre

There are some important rules:

* The "=" must be the first character on the line.
* There must be no text (not even whitespace) following the final "=" on
  the line.
* There must be at least one space character between the "=" characters
  and the actual text of the header.

If any of these rules are broken, the line will be formatted as normal text.

If you want blank lines before and after the header, you'll need to enter them
yourself.

# Special Characters

page {Special Characters} {The characters "&lb;", "&rb;", "&lt;", and "&gt;" are used as markup to enable
[text styles], [creating links to other pages], [embedded macro]s, and
[magic button]s.  What do you do if you want to put them in a page and have
them display as is?

You have several choices.

* Use [preformatted text].  Except for [embedded macro]s, all of the special
  markup is displayed as is in [preformatted text].

* The "<" and ">" characters are only special in the "&lt;b&gt;" tag and its
  companions; see [Text Styles] and [Section Headers].  Otherwise,
  you can use them freely.

* Or, you can use one of the following "escape sequences", which will be
  replaced by the character you chose:

     Character    Escape Sequence    Mnemonic
     ---------    ---------------    -----------------
         [              &lb;         "Left Bracket"
         ]              &rb;         "Right Bracket"
         <              &lt;         "Less Than"
         >              &gt;         "Greater Than"

: Escape sequences work everywhere but in [directives] and 
  [preformatted text].} 1072223045

# super

page super {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>super <i>...</i></m>

= Description =

The <m>super</m> command is an alias for <m>uplevel #0</m> in the
application's main interpreter; it allows your code to touch the
application itself.

You probably shouldn't use <m>super</m> unless the preceding
explanation was sufficient to tell you what it's for.  Used carelessly,
<m>super</m> can damage the integrity of the application--and possibly
cause you to lose your data.

= Examples =

I don't think so.

'''Extensions Directory:'''  If your [User Code Page] draws on any Tcl/Tk
extension packages, you can enter the absolute path of the directory that
contains them here.  After you restart, your [User Code] should be able
to "require" the packages.  See also [TkImg Extension].} 1114385601


#--------------------------------------------------
# template

page template {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>template <i>name arglist</i> ?<i>initbody</i>? <i>template</i></m>

= Description =

The [template] command defines a new command used to format text.  The
new command has a <i>name</i> and <i>arglist</i> just like a normal Tcl
"proc".  The <i>template</i> is a text string that can contain embedded
commands and variables.  When you call the template command, the
variables and commands are substituted into the text string, which is
then returned.

If given, the optional <i>initbody</i> is executed before the
substitution is done; it will usually define new variables for use in
the <i>template</i>

If the first non-blank line of the <i>template</i> is "|<--", then the
vertical bar character specifies the left margin; see [tsubst] for more.

Use templates as [embedded macro]s.

= Examples =

The following template greets the user and tells them the name of the
current page:

#pre
template greeting {first last} {
    |<--
    Hello, $first $last!

    You're looking at a page called '[Current]'!
}
#unpre

The "|<--" is very important; it indicates that all of the whitespace
to the left of the "|<--" should be thrown away.  That means that when
this macro is expanded, the lines of text will begin in the first
column, and will be formatted normally.  If "|<--" was omitted, the
returned text would be assumed to be preformatted.

Here's what this template looks like as an embedded macro:

#pre
[@lb@]greeting John Doe[@rb@]
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc template@]} 1114962110


#--------------------------------------------------
# Text Styles

page {Text Styles} {You can add <b>boldface</b>, <i>italics</i>, or <m>monospace</m> text, or any
combination of the three to any text you like; you can also add
<h>Header Text</h> and <s>very small text</s>.

= Bold And Italic Text =

Text can be '''bolded''' and ''italicized'' using either a traditional
wiki-like notation or an HTML-like notation:

#pre
This is '''bold''' and so is <b>this</b>.
#unpre

This is '''bold''' and so is <b>this</b>.

#pre
This is ''italicized'' and so is <i>this</i>.
#unpre

This is ''italicized'' and so is <i>this</i>.

Boldface and italics can be combined, using either style:

#pre
Wiki-style: '''''bold and italics'''''
#unpre

Wiki-style: '''''bold and italics'''''

#pre
HTML-style: <b><i>bold and italics</i></b>
#unpre

HTML-style: <b><i>bold and italics</i></b>


= Other Text Styles =

The other text styles have only an HTML-like syntax:

* <m>&lt;m&gt;...&lt;/m&gt;</m>  -- Display the enclosed text in monospace.
* <m>&lt;h&gt;...&lt;/h&gt;</m>  -- Display the enclosed text as an inline header.
* <m>&lt;s&gt;...&lt;/s&gt;</m>  -- Display the enclosed text so that it
  doesn't stand out.
* <m>&lt;x&gt;...&lt;/x&gt;</m>  -- Display the enclosed text with a line
  through it.

For example, if you typed in this:

#pre
: Some words are <b>bold</b> and others are <i>italicized</i>, and some
  are <b><i>both</i></b>, while others are <x>struck out</x>.  Note that 
  <h>Inline Header text</h> and <s>small text</s> cannot be combined with 
  the other styles.  <x>strikeout</x> can be <x><h>combined</h> with 
  <s>anything</s></x>
#unpre

you'd get

: Some words are <b>bold</b> and others are <i>italicized</i>, and some
  are <b><i>both</i></b>, while others are <x>struck out</x>.  Note that 
  <h>Inline Header text</h> and <s>small text</s> cannot be combined with 
  the other styles.  <x>strikeout</x> can be <x><h>combined</h> with 
  <s>anything</s></x>

If you leave out the closing tags, the style will last only to 
the end of the paragraph.} 1114360808

# The Tcl Language

page {The Tcl Language} {Tcl is a simple scripting language; in fact, it's the language in which
Notebook is written.  You can use Tcl to extend Notebook however you like,
by [defining new commands] on your "User Code" page.

For more about Tcl, go to <m>http://www.tcl.tk</m>.  You can also find
out more about Tcl at the Tcler's Wiki, <m>http://wiki.tcl.tk</m>, and
the Usenet newsgroup <m>comp.lang.tcl</m>.} 1072224096


#--------------------------------------------------
# TkImg Extension

page {TkImg Extension} {The TkImg extension is a binary extension to Tcl/Tk that allows Tcl/Tk
applications to read and write a variety of image formats.  If you're
using Notebook on Mac OS X, then TkImg was included with the executable. 
Otherwise, you'll have to get your own copy.  You need at least TkImg 1.3.

= TkImg on SourceForge =

One way to get TkImg is to download the source from SourceForge and build
it yourself.  The address is

: <m>http://sourceforge.net/projects/tkimg/</m>

= ActiveTcl =

Alternatively, if you download ActiveTcl for your
platform you'll TkImg along with it.  ActiveTcl is a "batteries included"
distribution of the Tcl/Tk programming language; that means it comes with
lots of extra packages, like TkImg.  You can get ActiveTcl from 

: <m>http://www.activestate.com</m>

= Making TkImg Accessible to Notebook =

Once you've got TkImg either built or installed with ActiveTcl, the next
step is to find it on your disk.  If you built it, of course, you can put
it whereever you like.  If you installed ActiveTcl, then there will be a 
"lib" directory somewhere which contains subdirectories for all of the
packages.  One of these subdirectories will be called "Img"; that's the
one you want.

Now, invoke the [User Preferences] window; there's a new tab labeled 
"Tcl/Tk".  On that tab is an entry labeled "Extensions Directory:".
Put the name of the directory containing the TkImg library in that entry,
press "Apply", and then shutdown and restart Notebook.  

Once you've restarted Notebook, pop up the Message Log window; there
will be an entry saying whether Notebook was able to load TkImg or
not.} 1114385446


#--------------------------------------------------
# tsubst

page tsubst {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature tsubst@]

= Description =

[tsubst] is a modified version of the standard Tcl "subst" command. 
The <i>template</i> is a string containing (possibly) variable
references, command references, and backslashes; [tsubst] substitutes
the value of the variables and commands into the string in place of the
references, and removes the backslashes, and returns the result.

If the first non-blank line of the <i>template</i> is the string
"|<--", then the "|" character specifies the left margin of the
<i>template</i>; all whitespace characters to the left of "|<--" will
be thrown away.

[tsubst] is a convenient way to format a large block of text.  If you
need to use [tsubst] with the same <i>template</i> in several places,
consider using the [template] command instead.

= Examples =

The code

#pre
set name "John Doe"
tsubst {
    |<--
    Hello, $name!
}
#unpre

returns the string "Hello, John Doe!"

= Implementation =

[@showproc tsubst@]} 1114962114

# undo-change

page undo-change {#rem command
#rem action
= Syntax =

<m>undo-change</m>

= Description =

This command can be invoked as a [User Interface Action].

While editing, calling [undo-change] will undo the last set of edits;
it's equivalent to selecting Edit/Undo from the application menu.

= Examples =

[undo-change] is mostly useful as an item on your [editmenu].

= Implementation =

[@showproc undo-change@]} 1115585605


#--------------------------------------------------
# User Code

page {User Code} {In a typical notebook, this page is used to customize the behavior or
your notebook by defining new [Notebook Commands], [customizing the User
Menu], and [customizing the Edit Menu].  In this Help notebook, it
contains the Tcl code I use to maintain the Notebook on-line help.  See
[User Code Page] for more about the [User Code] page.

If you're interested in teaching your Notebook to do magic, go ahead and
read the rest of the page; it's well-documented.  If you want to use any 
of the new commands, you'll need to copy the Tcl code to your own [User
Code] page.

Note that each of the code blocks is bracketed by <m>[#Tcl]</m>
and <m>[#unTcl]</m> directives; these indicate that the code is
in fact Tcl code, and may be loaded and executed.

= The Editor User Menu =

The [editmenu] command defines the popup menu that appears when you 
right-click in the [Page Editor] window; see [Customizing the Edit Menu]
for details.  In this case, I use the Edit menu to insert two kinds of 
template text into new pages.  The first, <m>insert-manpage</m>, inserts
the skeleton of a [Notebook Command] page; the second,
<m>insert-menu-item</m>, inserts a fragment of text documenting a menu
item.  Both of these commands are defined lower done on this page.

#Tcl -- Edit Menu
editmenu {
    "Template: Manpage"     {insert-manpage}
    "Template: Menu Item"   {insert-menu-item}
}
#unTcl

= Indenting Blocks of Text =

Given a block of text, the <m>indent</m> command indents the block by
the specified amount of whitespace.  Put another way, the value of
<i>spaces</i> is prepended to each line of text in <i>text</i>.  By
default, that's one space character.

#Tcl -- indent
proc indent {text {spaces " "}} {
    join [split "$spaces[string trim $text]" "\n"] "\n$spaces"
}
#unTcl

= Removing Unwanted Indentation =

The <m>indent</m> adds a white-space string to the beginning of each line
in a block of text; the following command does the opposite: it figures
out how much the block of text as a whole has been indented, and removes
the indent.

#Tcl -- unmargin
proc unmargin {text} {
    # FIRST, break the text into lines.
    set lines [split $text "\n"]

    # NEXT, skip any initial blank lines.
    while {[llength $lines] > 0} {
        set line [lindex $lines 0]

        if {[string trim $line] eq ""} {
            lshift lines
        } else {
            break
        }
    }

    # NEXT, for the remaining non-blank lines determine the length of the 
    # minimum whitespace prefix.

    set min 100

    foreach line $lines {
        if {[regexp {^(\s*)\S} $line dummy prefix]} {
            set len [string length $prefix]
            if {$len < $min} {
                set min $len
            }
        }
    }

    # NEXT, remove that much space from the block of text.
    set prefix [string repeat " " $min]

    regsub -all "\n$prefix" [string trim $text] "\n" text

    return $text
}
#unTcl

= Formatting Tables of Links =

The [Notebook Commands] page and the [User Interface Actions] page each
contain a list of command names or action names formatted as a
multi-column alphabetized table of links to the relevant help pages.
Notebook has no table capability at present, but the following command
cheats by taking advantage of the fact that command and action names are
displayed in a <m>monospace</m> font.  Given the names, it figures out
how many columns will fit, and how wide each column should be, and pads
each column with spaces so that the names all line up.

#Tcl -- linktable
proc linktable {names} {
    # FIRST, get the maximum name length.
    set max 0
    
    foreach name $names {
        set len [string length $name]
        if {$len > $max} {
            set max $len
        }
    }

    # NEXT, add 2 for column breaks.
    incr max 2

    # NEXT, compute the number of columns
    set ncols [expr {int(75/$max)}]

    # NEXT, format the table.
    set result ": <m>"
    set col 0

    set fmt "%-[expr {$max + 2}]s"
    foreach name $names {
        append result [format $fmt "\[$name\]  "]
        incr col
        if {$col == $ncols} {
            append result "</m>\n: <m>"
            set col 0
        }
    }

    append result "</m>\n"

    return $result
}
#unTcl

= Auto-Generating Tables of Links =

The following command generates a table of links by
searching on a <m>[#rem]</m> keyword.

#Tcl
proc autolinktable {keyword} {
    linktable [pagesearch "#rem $keyword"]
}
#unTcl

= Retrieving Command Signatures =

The "signature" of a [Notebook Command] -- or any other kind of Tcl
command, really, is a line of text that includes the command's name and
the name of each argument.  Each argument name is enclosed in question marks
if the argument is optional.

Every notebook command page in this help document includes the signature
of the command.  Keeping those signatures up to date as commands evolve
is a nuisance--if you try to do it by hand.  Instead, I use the 
<m>signature</m> [embedded macro]. Given a command name, <m>signature</m>
returns the signature of the named command.

<m>signature</m> takes two options:

<m>-argstext <i>text</i></m>
: Use this option when the command has an "args" argument; the
  <i>text</i> is substituted in the signature for the word "args".

<m>-link <i>flag</i></m>
: If <i>flag</i> is non-zero, the command name in the returned signature
  will be a link to the named command's page.

<m>signature</m> is defined as follows:

#Tcl -- signature
proc signature {procname args} {
    set opt(-argstext) ""
    set opt(-link) 0

    foreach {option value} $args {
        if {![info exists opt($option)]} {
            error "Unknown option $option"
        }
        set opt($option) $value
    }

    set argspec {} 

    foreach arg [info args $procname] {
        if {$arg eq "args"} {
            if {$opt(-argstext) ne ""} {
                append argspec "?<i>$opt(-argstext)</i>? "
            } else {
                append argspec "?<i>args...</i>?"
            }
        } elseif {[info default $procname $arg defvalue]} {
            append argspec "?<i>$arg</i>? "
        } else {
            append argspec "<i>$arg</i> "
        }
    }

    if {$opt(-link)} {
        set procname "\[$procname\]"
    }

    return "<m>$procname [string trim $argspec]</m>"
}
#unTcl

= Showing the Implementation of a Notebook Command =

The <m>showproc</m> command is related to the <m>signature</m> command,
but instead of retrieving the signature of a specified command, it returns
a copy of the command's definition, that is, the command's code.  This is
not always possible; some standard [Notebook command]s are defined in 
such a way that their implementation isn't accessible.  In that case,
<m>showproc</m> returns the text "<i>The code is unavailable</i>".

If desired, you can specify an indent string; it will be prepended to
each line of the command definition.

#Tcl -- showproc
proc showproc {procname {indent "  "}} {
    # FIRST, is this a proc?
    if {[info procs $procname] eq ""} {
        return "<i>The code is unavailable.</i>"
    }

    # NEXT, format the argument list
    set argspec {}

    foreach arg [info args $procname] {
        if {[info default $procname $arg defvalue]} {
            lappend argspec [list $arg $defvalue]
        } else {
            lappend argspec $arg
        }
    }

    # NEXT, get the body, and strip off the extra whitespace at the
    # beginning of each line.
    set body [unmargin [info body $procname]]
    
    # NEXT, get the full proc definition, and indent it one space.
    set procdef "proc $procname {$argspec} {\n[indent $body {    }]\n}"

    return "\n#pre\n$procdef\n#unpre\n"
}
#unTcl

= Man Page Templates =

In Unix parlance, a "man page" -- short for "manual page" -- is a single
page that documents some program, command, function, file format, or what
have you.  Given that I'm a Unix programmer by trade, I tend to think of
the Notebook page that documents each [Notebook command] as a man page.
The following [template] defines the skeleton for a new man page.  As you
can see, this skeleton includes the <m>signature</m> and <m>showproc</m>
[embedded macro]s defined above.

The <m>manpage</m> [template] creates a man page skeleton; the
<m>insert-manpage</m> command, defined below, actually inserts it into a
page in the page editor.

#Tcl -- manpage
template manpage {command} {
    |<--
    [mankeywords $command]
    = Syntax =

    \[\@signature $command@\]

    = Description =

    TBD.
    
    = Examples =

    #pre
    $command
    #unpre

    = Implementation =

    \[\@showproc $command\@\]
}

proc mankeywords {command} {
    # Split the result so that it doesn't match searches
    set result "#rem "
    append result "command"
    if {[string match "*-*" $command]} {
        append result "\n#rem "
        append result "action"
    }

    return $result
}
#unTcl

The following command inserts a man page skeleton into the page currently
being edited in the [Page Editor].  As you can see, it assumes that the
page name, returned by "<m>[current]</m>", is the name of the command to
document.

#Tcl
proc insert-manpage {} {
    insert [manpage [current]]
}
#unTcl

= Inserting Menu Item Entries =

In the help pages that document Notebook's various menus, there's a
standard form for documenting each menu item.  The menu item's name is
show in bold, followed by the name of the associated [user interface
action] in small type.  The description begins on the next line,
indented.  The following command prompts for the menu item name and the
action name, and inserts it all in the proper format.

#Tcl -- insert-menu-item
proc insert-menu-item {} {
    set item [askfor "Menu Item"]
    set action [askfor "Action"]
    insert [tsubst {
        |<--
        * <b>$item</b> <s>(\[$action\])</s><br>
          }]
}
#unTcl

= HTML Style Sheet =

We can use the <m>html</m> command to configure Notebook's HTML export
features.  In particular, we can include style-sheet information in the
exported pages.  (Alas, it doesn't affect pages exported just as
<m>html-text</m>.)

#Tcl
html configure -css {
    h1 { 
        color: yellow; 
        background: #990000;
        margin-left: -4%;
        font-family: "Arial Rounded MT Bold" Helvetica Arial sans;
    }
    h2, h3, h4 { 
        margin-left: -4%;
        font-family: "Arial Rounded MT Bold" Helvetica Arial sans;
    }
    hr {
        margin-left:  -5%;
        margin-right: -5%;
    }
    body { margin-left: 5% ; margin-right: 5%; }
    pre { 
        outline: thin dashed blue;

Notebook will attempt to complete your partial response.
Each of these actions has an associated [Notebook Command]; in most cases
the name of the action and the command are identical.  In a few cases, a
number of actions map to a single command.

The only
difference between invoking an action using File/Invoke Action and
calling it as a command is that the action will always prompt for any needed
inputs whereas the inputs can usually also be passed explicitly to the
command.

# usermenu

page usermenu {#rem command
= Syntax =

[@signature usermenu@]

= Description =

Allows the user to define the items for the "User Menu".  The User
Menu pops up when the user right-clicks on a browsed page.

The <i>menulist</i> is a list of item definitions.  Each item is
defined by its name and a script of commands to execute.  The
<m>usermenu</m> command shown below defined three items, labeled
"Edit Home", "View To Do", and "Edit To Do", respectively; the script
which follows each label is executed when the item is selected.

If the label is "separator" then a separator is added to the menu
instead of a normal item; in this case the script of commands is ignored.

= Examples =

#pre
usermenu {
    "Back"       {back-page}
    "Forward"    {forward-page}
    separator    {}
    "Edit Home"  {edit-page Home}
    "View To Do" {goto-page "To Do"}
    "Edit To Do" {edit-page "To Do"}
}
#unpre

= Implementation =

[@showproc usermenu@]} 1114962122


#--------------------------------------------------
# version

page version {#rem command
= Syntax =

<m>version</m>

= Description =

Returns the version number of the Notebook application.

= Examples =

The following [embedded macro] inserts the version number into a page:

#pre
[@lb@]version[@rb@]
#unpre

It looks like this: '[@version@]'.
